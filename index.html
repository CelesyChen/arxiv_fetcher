Hu, Xiaojun Lin</p><p>Modern warehouse-scale datacenters commonly collocate multiple jobs on shared machines to improve resource utilization. However, such collocation often leads to performance interference caused by antagonistic jobs that overconsume shared resources. Existing antagonist-detection approaches either rely on offline profiling, which is costly and unscalable, or use a sample-from-production approach, which suffers from noisy measurements and fails under multi-victim scenarios. We present PANDA, a noise-resilient antagonist identification framework for production-scale datacenters. Like prior correlation-based methods, PANDA uses cycles per instruction (CPI) as its performance metric, but it differs by (i) leveraging global historical knowledge across all machines to suppress sampling noise and (ii) introducing a machine-level CPI metric that captures shared-resource contention among multiple co-located tasks. Evaluation on a recent Google production trace shows that PANDA ranks true antagonists far more accurately than prior methods -- improving average suspicion percentile from 50-55% to 82.6% -- and achieves consistent antagonist identification under multi-victim scenarios, all with negligible runtime overhead.</p><p><h4>cs.PF</h4></p></div><hr>

Four major cloud providers by market share AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) are compared across Intel, AMD, and ARM general purpose instance types under both on-demand and one-year discounted pricing. AWS consistently delivers the shortest runtime in all three instance types, yet charges a premium, especially for on-demand usage. OCI emerges as the most economical option across all CPU families, although it generally runs workloads more slowly than AWS. Azure often exhibits mid-range performance and cost, while GCP presents a mixed profile: it sees a notable boost when moving from Intel to AMD. On the other hand, its ARM instance is more than twice as slow as its own AMD offering and remains significantly more expensive. AWS&#x27;s internal comparisons reveal that its ARM instance can outperform its Intel and AMD siblings by up to 49 percent in runtime. These findings highlight how instance choices and provider selection can yield substantial variations in both runtime and price, indicating that workload priorities, whether raw speed or cost minimization, should guide decisions on instance types.</p><p><h4>cs.DC, cs.PF</h4></p></div><hr>

However, ensuring correctness in the presence of concurrency makes existing lock-free implementations significantly more complex than their original form. Coordination mechanisms introduced to prevent hazards such as ABA, use-after-free, and unsafe reclamation often dominate the design, overshadowing the queue itself. Many schemes compromise strict FIFO ordering, unbounded capacity, or lock-free progress to mask coordination overheads. Yet the true source of complexity lies in the pursuit of infinite protection against reclamation hazards--theoretically sound but impractical and costly. This pursuit not only drives unnecessary complexity but also creates a protection paradox where excessive protection reduces system resilience rather than improving it. While such costs may be tolerable in conventional workloads, the AI era has shifted the paradigm: training and inference pipelines involve hundreds to thousands of concurrent threads per node, and at this scale, protection and coordination overheads dominate, often far heavier than the basic queue operations themselves.  This paper introduces Cyclic Memory Protection (CMP), a coordination-free queue that preserves strict FIFO semantics, unbounded capacity, and lock-free progress while restoring simplicity. CMP reclaims the strict FIFO that other approaches sacrificed through bounded protection windows that provide practical reclamation guarantees. We prove strict FIFO and safety via linearizability and bounded reclamation analysis, and show experimentally that CMP outperforms state-of-the-art lock-free queues by up to 1.72-4x under high contention while maintaining scalability to hundreds of threads. Our work demonstrates that highly concurrent queues can return to their fundamental simplicity without weakening queue semantics.</p><p><h4>cs.DC, cs.DS, cs.PF</h4></p></div><hr>

To address this limitation, this work introduces an open-source platform that exploits Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) to accelerate SEU fault simulation. The platform includes three STGNN architectures incorporating advanced components such as Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) and attention mechanisms, thereby improving spatio-temporal feature extraction. In addition, SEU fault simulation datasets are constructed from six open-source circuits with varying levels of complexity, providing a comprehensive benchmark for performance evaluation. The predictive capability of the STGNN models is analyzed and compared on these datasets. Moreover, to further investigate the efficiency of the approach, we evaluate the predictive capability of STGNNs across multiple test cases and discuss their generalization capability.

In this work we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first implementation of selective code offloading to FPGAs via the OpenMP target directive within MLIR. Our approach combines the MLIR OpenMP dialect with a High-Level Synthesis (HLS) dialect to provide a portable compilation flow targeting FPGAs. Unlike prior OpenMP FPGA efforts that rely on custom compilers, by contrast we integrate with MLIR and so support any MLIR-compatible front end, demonstrated here with Flang. Building upon a range of existing MLIR building blocks significantly reduces the effort required and demonstrates the composability benefits of the MLIR ecosystem. Our approach supports manual optimisation of offloaded kernels through standard OpenMP directives, and this work establishes a flexible and extensible path for directive-based FPGA acceleration integrated within the MLIR ecosystem.</p><p><h4>cs.DC, cs.PL</h4></p></div><hr>

However, programming these architectures remains challenging due to the need for explicit orchestration of data movement through reconfigurable networks-on-chip and asynchronous computation triggered by data arrival. Existing FPGA and CGRA programming models emphasize loop scheduling but overlook the unique capabilities of spatial dataflow architectures, particularly efficient dataflow over regular grids and intricate routing management.  We present SPADA, a programming language that provides precise control over data placement, dataflow patterns, and asynchronous operations while abstracting architecture-specific low-level details. We introduce a rigorous dataflow semantics framework for SPADA that defines routing correctness, data races, and deadlocks. Additionally, we design and implement a compiler targeting Cerebras CSL with multi-level lowering.  SPADA serves as both a high-level programming interface and an intermediate representation for domain-specific languages (DSLs), which we demonstrate with the GT4Py stencil DSL. SPADA enables developers to express complex parallel patterns -- including pipelined reductions and multi-dimensional stencils -- in 6--8x less code than CSL with near-ideal weak scaling across three orders of magnitude. By unifying programming for spatial dataflow architectures under a single model, SPADA advances both the theoretical foundations and practical usability of these emerging high-performance computing platforms.</p><p><h4>cs.DC, cs.PL</h4></p></div><hr>

Chien</p><p>The exploding power consumption of AI and cloud datacenters (DCs) intensifies the long-standing concerns about their carbon footprint, especially because DCs&#x27; need for constant power clashes with volatile renewable generation needed for grid decarbonization. DC flexibility (a.k.a. load adaptation) is a key to reducing DC carbon emissions by improving grid renewable absorption.  DC flexibility can be created, without disturbing datacenter capacity by decoupling a datacenter&#x27;s power capacity and grid load with a collection of energy resources. Because decoupling can be costly, we study how to best distribute and manage decoupling to maximize benefits for all. Key considerations include site variation and datacenter-grid cooperation.  We first define and compute the power and energy needs of datacenter load decoupling, and then we evaluate designed distribution and management approaches. Evaluation shows that optimized distribution can deliver &gt;98% of the potential grid carbon reduction with 70% of the total decoupling need. For management, DC-grid cooperation (2-way sharing and control vs. 1-way info sharing) enables 1.4x grid carbon reduction. Finally, we show that decoupling may be economically viable, as on average datacenters can get power cost and carbon emissions benefits greater than their local costs of decoupling. However, skew across sites suggests grid intervention may be required.</p><p><h4>cs.DC, cs.SY, eess.SY</h4></p></div><hr>

However, building user-friendly enterprise-level FL frameworks that are both scalable and privacy-preserving remains challenging, especially when bridging the gap between local prototyping and distributed deployment across heterogeneous client computing infrastructures. In this paper, based on our experiences building the Advanced Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (APPFL) framework, we present our vision for an enterprise-grade, privacy-preserving FL framework designed to scale seamlessly across computing environments. We identify several key capabilities that such a framework must provide: (1) Scalable local simulation and prototyping to accelerate experimentation and algorithm design; (2) seamless transition from simulation to deployment; (3) distributed deployment across diverse, real-world infrastructures, from personal devices to cloud clusters and HPC systems; (4) multi-level abstractions that balance ease of use and research flexibility; and (5) comprehensive privacy and security through techniques such as differential privacy, secure aggregation, robust authentication, and confidential computing. We further discuss architectural designs to realize these goals. This framework aims to bridge the gap between research prototypes and enterprise-scale deployment, enabling scalable, reliable, and privacy-preserving AI for science.</p><p><h4>cs.DC</h4></p></div><hr>

Among them, NVIDIA Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) has gained traction for providing hardware-level isolation that enables concurrent workloads without interference. However, MIG&#x27;s hardware rigidity and the conventional one-to-one allocation model jointly lead to severe fragmentation and cluster-wide underutilization. We present Flex-MIG, a software-only framework that replaces one-to-one with a one-to-many allocation model and enables host-shared-memory collectives across MIG instances without hardware modification. Flex-MIG eliminates drain-required reconfiguration, reduces fragmentation, and improves makespan by up to 17% across diverse traces, showing that rethinking MIG&#x27;s operational model as a software-coordinated layer substantially improves cluster efficiency.</p><p><h4>cs.DC</h4></p></div><hr>

One of the greatest advantages of this is that concurrency and synchronization is manged entirely in the userspace, omitting heavy-weight system calls. However, we find that state-of-the-art userspace synchronization primitives approach synchronization in the userspace from the perspective of kernel-level scheduling. This introduces unnecessary delays on the critical path of the application, limiting throughput. In this paper, we re-think synchronization for tasks that are scheduled entirely in the userspace (e.g., coroutines, fibers, etc.). We develop Combine-and-Exchange Scheduling (CES), a novel scheduling approach that ensures contended critical sections stay on the same thread of execution while parallelizable work is evenly spread across the remaining threads. We show that our approach can be applied to many existing languages and libraries, resulting in 3-fold performance improvements in application benchmarks as well as 8-fold performance improvements in microbenchmarks.</p><p><h4>cs.DC</h4></p></div><hr>

Model-parallel strategies must now efficiently scale not only across multiple GPUs but also across multiple nodes. In this work, we present a detailed performance study of multi-node distributed inference using LLMs on GPU-based supercomputers. We conduct experiments with several state-of-the-art inference engines alongside YALIS, a research-oriented prototype engine designed for controlled experimentation. We analyze the strong-scaling behavior of different model-parallel schemes and identify key bottlenecks. Since all-reduce operations are a common performance bottleneck, we develop NVRAR, a hierarchical all-reduce algorithm based on recursive doubling with NVSHMEM. NVRAR achieves up to 1.9x-3.6x lower latency than NCCL for message sizes between 128 KB and 2 MB on HPE Slingshot and InfiniBand interconnects.

Each family is illustrated through concise Solidity examples, exploit mechanics, and mitigations, and linked to the detection signals observable by static, dynamic, and learning-based tools. We further cross-map legacy datasets (SmartBugs, SolidiFI) to this taxonomy to reveal label drift and coverage gaps.

Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update. To demonstrate the practical benefits of FedPM, we conducted extensive experiments. The results showed significant improvements with FedPM in the test accuracy compared to conventional methods incorporating simple mixing, fully leveraging the potential of second-order optimization.</p><p><h4>cs.LG, cs.DC</h4></p></div><hr>

In particular, CheetahGIS is built upon Apache Flink Stateful Functions (StateFun), an API for building distributed streaming applications with an actor-like model. CheetahGIS enjoys excellent scalability due to its modular architecture, which clearly decomposes different components and allows scaling individual components. To improve the efficiency and scalability of CheetahGIS, we devise a suite of optimizations, e.g., lightweight global grid-based index, metadata synchroniza tion strategies, and load balance mechanisms. We also formulate a generic paradigm for spatial query processing in CheetahGIS, and verify its generality by processing three representative streaming queries (i.e., object query, range count query, and k nearest neighbor query).

By leveraging the superposition of multiple access channels, OTA computing enables efficient resource management by supporting simultaneous uncoded transmission in the time and frequency domains. To advance the integration of OTA computing, our study presents a theoretical analysis that addresses practical issues encountered in current digital communication transceivers, such as transmitter synchronization (sync) errors and intersymbol interference (ISI). To this end, we investigate the theoretical mean squared error (MSE) for OTA transmission under sync errors and ISI, while also exploring methods for minimizing the MSE in OTA transmission. Using alternating optimization, we also derive optimal power policies for both the devices and the base station. In addition, we propose a novel deep neural network (DNN)-based approach to design waveforms that improve OTA transmission performance under sync errors and ISI. To ensure a fair comparison with existing waveforms such as raised cosine (RC) and better-than-raised-cosine (BTRC), we incorporate a custom loss function that integrates energy and bandwidth constraints along with practical design considerations such as waveform symmetry. Simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate performance gains of the designed pulse over RC and BTRC waveforms. To facilitate testing of our results without the need to rebuild the DNN structure, we also provide curve-fitting parameters for the selected DNN-based waveforms.</p><p><h4>cs.IT, cs.DC, cs.LG, eess.SP, math.IT, math.ST, stat.TH</h4></p></div><hr>
