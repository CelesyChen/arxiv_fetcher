To address the low inference efficiency of LLMs across diverse heterogeneous platforms, this paper proposes a practical optimization method, Opt4GPTQ, designed for 4-bit GPTQ quantized LLMs inference on heterogeneous AI accelerators. Built upon the vLLM serving system, Opt4GPTQ integrates three platform-level optimization strategies: Shared Memory Buffering optimization (SMB-Opt), which caches data in shared memory and employs single-threaded writes; Vectorized Memory Loading optimization (VML-Opt), which utilizes vectorized memory operations for efficient data loading; and Inline Assembly optimization (ILAOpt), which directly leverages hardware-native vector halfprecision addition and fused multiply-accumulate instructions for efficient execution. Experimental results show that Opt4GPTQ effectively improves inference performance across different models, achieving up to 84.42% throughput improvement and up to 51.35% latency reduction. This work highlights the critical role of platform-level engineering optimizations in enabling efficient LLMs inference on emerging heterogeneous AI acceleration architectures and provides valuable deployment experience and methodologies for future heterogeneous platform adaptation.</p><p><h4>cs.DC, cs.PF</h4></p></div><hr>

For optimal efficiency, analyzing each subtask and scheduling it on the best-suited hardware would be necessary. Other considerations must be taken into account, too, such as parallelism, dependencies between different subtasks, and data transfer speeds between devices. To achieve this, directed acyclic graphs are often employed to represent these problems and enable utilizing as much hardware as possible on a given machine. In this paper, we present a software framework written in Julia capable of automatically and dynamically producing statically scheduled and compiled code. We lay theoretical foundations and add domain-specific information about the computation to the existing concepts of DAG scheduling, enabling optimizations that would otherwise be impossible. To illustrate the theory we implement an example application: the computation of matrix elements for scattering processes with many external particles in quantum electrodynamics.</p><p><h4>cs.DC, cs.PF</h4></p></div><hr>

We revisit this bottleneck through the lens of speculation. While traditional predict-verify speculation paradigm can break serial execution, its benefit remains limited, as it retains the full original workload and adds extra inference overhead. We observe that early agent steps often involve simple evidence-gathering, where correct actions can often be predicted without full reasoning. Building on these observations, we present SPAgent, an algorithm-system co-design framework that expands the role of speculation in search agents to reduce latency. Algorithmically, SPAgent introduces a two-phase adaptive speculation mechanism that selectively omits verification when safe. System-wise, a two-level scheduler regulates speculative requests based on engine load to ensure speculation remains beneficial. We implement SPAgent in real-world systems. Across extensive experimental settings, SPAgent achieves up to $1.65\times$ end-to-end speedup while maintaining same or even achieving higher accuracy, enabling practical deployment of multi-step search agents.</p><p><h4>cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.PF</h4></p></div><hr>

Such fragmentation stems from the use of online GPU memory allocators in popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, which disregard tensor lifespans. As a result, this inefficiency can waste as much as 43% of memory and trigger out-of-memory errors, undermining the effectiveness of optimization methods. To address this, we introduce STAlloc, a GPU memory allocator for deep learning frameworks that reduces fragmentation by exploiting the spatial and temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors of training workloads. STAlloc introduces a novel paradigm that combines offline planning with online allocation. The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Built as a pluggable PyTorch memory allocator, STAlloc reduces fragmentation ratio on average by 85.1% (up to 100%) across both dense and MoE models, with negligible overhead. This enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations and improves throughput performance by up to 32.5%.</p><p><h4>cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.DC, cs.PF</h4></p></div><hr>

While large LLCs can reduce average memory access latency for workloads with a high degree of locality, they can also increase latency for workloads with irregular memory access patterns. Prefetchers are widely used to reduce memory latency by prefetching data into the cache hierarchy before it is accessed by the core. However, existing prediction-based prefetchers often struggle with irregular memory access patterns, which are especially prevalent in modern applications. This paper introduces the Pickle Prefetcher, a programmable and scalable LLC prefetcher designed to handle independent irregular memory access patterns effectively. Instead of relying on static heuristics or complex prediction algorithms, Pickle Prefetcher allows software to define its own prefetching strategies using a simple programming interface without expanding the instruction set architecture (ISA). By trading the logic complexity of hardware prediction for software programmability, Pickle Prefetcher can adapt to a wide range of access patterns without requiring extensive hardware resources for prediction. This allows the prefetcher to dedicate its resources to scheduling and issuing timely prefetch requests. Graph applications are an example where the memory access pattern is irregular but easily predictable by software. Through extensive evaluations of the Pickle Prefetcher on gem5 full-system simulations, we demonstrate tha Pickle Prefetcher significantly outperforms traditional prefetching techniques. Our results show that Pickle Prefetcher achieves speedups of up to 1.74x on the GAPBS breadth-first search (BFS) implementation over a baseline system. When combined with private cache prefetchers, Pickle Prefetcher provides up to a 1.40x speedup over systems using only private cache prefetchers.</p><p><h4>cs.AR</h4></p></div><hr>

Traditional automatic program repair (APR) methods define dedicated search spaces to locate and fix bugs with program synthesis. However, they heavily rely on fixed templates and can only deal with limited bugs. As an alternative, Large Language Models with the ability to understand code semantics can be explored for RTL repair. However, they suffer from unreliable outcomes due to inherent randomness and long input contexts of RTL code and waveform. To address these challenges, we propose R3A, an LLM-based automatic RTL program repair framework upon the basic model to improve reliability. R3A proposes the stochastic Tree-Of-Thoughts method to control a patch generation agent to explore a validated solution for the bug. The algorithm samples search states according to a heuristic function to balance between exploration and exploitation for a reliable outcome. Besides, R3A proposes a multi-agent fault localization method to find fault candidates as the starting points for the patch generation agent, further increasing the reliability. Experiments show R3A can fix 90.6% of bugs in the RTL-repair dataset within a given time limit, which covers 45% more bugs than traditional methods and other LLM-based approaches, while achieving an 86.7% pass@5 rate on average, showing a high reliability.</p><p><h4>cs.AR, cs.AI</h4></p></div><hr>

However, designing optimized prefix adders is challenging due to strict design rules and an exponentially large design space. We introduce PrefixGPT, a generative pre-trained Transformer (GPT) that directly generates optimized prefix adders from scratch. Our approach represents an adder&#x27;s topology as a two-dimensional coordinate sequence and applies a legality mask during generation, ensuring every design is valid by construction. PrefixGPT features a customized decoder-only Transformer architecture. The model is first pre-trained on a corpus of randomly synthesized valid prefix adders to learn design rules and then fine-tuned to navigate the design space for optimized design quality. Compared with existing works, PrefixGPT not only finds a new optimal design with a 7.7% improved area-delay product (ADP) but exhibits superior exploration quality, lowering the average ADP by up to 79.1%. This demonstrates the potential of GPT-style models to first master complex hardware design principles and then apply them for more efficient design optimization.</p><p><h4>cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.AR</h4></p></div><hr>

ADL compilers optimize datapaths and convert software-like control flow constructs into control paths. Such compilers are necessarily complex and often unpredictable: they must bridge the wide semantic gap between high-level semantics and cycle-level schedules, and they typically rely on advanced heuristics to optimize circuits. The resulting performance can be difficult to control, requiring guesswork to find and resolve performance problems in the generated hardware. We conjecture that ADL compilers will never be perfect: some performance unpredictability is endemic to the problem they solve.  In lieu of compiler perfection, we argue for compiler understanding tools that give ADL programmers insight into how the compiler&#x27;s decisions affect performance. We introduce Petal, a cycle-level Petal for the Calyx intermediate language (IL). Petal instruments the Calyx code with probes and then analyzes the trace from a register-transfer-level simulation. It maps the events in the trace back to high-level control constructs in the Calyx code to track the clock cycles when each construct was active. Using case studies, we demonstrate that Petal&#x27;s cycle-level profiles can identify performance problems in existing accelerator designs. We show that these insights can also guide developers toward optimizations that the compiler was unable to perform automatically, including a reduction by 46.9\% of total cycles for one application.</p><p><h4>cs.PL, cs.AR, cs.SE</h4></p></div><hr>

However, existing approaches often rely on free-form natural language descriptions that are often ambiguous, redundant, and unstructured, which poses significant challenges for downstream Verilog code generation. We treat hardware code generation as a complex transformation from an open-ended natural language space to a domain-specific, highly constrained target space. To bridge this gap, we introduce Core Refined Understanding eXpression (CRUX), a structured intermediate space that captures the essential semantics of user intent while organizing the expression for precise Verilog code generation. We further design a two-stage training framework, comprising Joint Expression Modeling and Dual-Space Optimization, to enhance the quality of both CRUX and Verilog code. Experiments across multiple Verilog generation benchmarks demonstrate that our model, CRUX-V, achieves state-of-the-art performance among general models, particularly under challenging design tasks. Furthermore, the CRUX space proves transferable and beneficial when used as input prompts for other code models, highlighting its effectiveness in narrowing the gap between free-form natural language descriptions and precise Verilog generation.</p><p><h4>cs.LG, cs.AR, cs.PL</h4></p></div><hr>

Modern LLM serving extends beyond traditional prefill-decode workflows, incorporating multi-stage processes such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), key-value (KV) cache retrieval, dynamic model routing, and multi step reasoning. These stages exhibit diverse computational demands, requiring distributed systems that integrate GPUs, ASICs, CPUs, and memory-centric architectures. However, existing simulators lack the fidelity to model these heterogeneous, multi-engine workflows, limiting their ability to inform architectural decisions.  To address this gap, we introduce HERMES, a Heterogeneous Multi-stage LLM inference Execution Simulator. HERMES models diverse request stages; including RAG, KV retrieval, reasoning, prefill, and decode across complex hardware hierarchies. HERMES supports heterogeneous clients executing multiple models concurrently unlike prior frameworks while incorporating advanced batching strategies and multi-level memory hierarchies. By integrating real hardware traces with analytical modeling, HERMES captures critical trade-offs such as memory bandwidth contention, inter-cluster communication latency, and batching efficiency in hybrid CPU-accelerator deployments. Through case studies, we explore the impact of reasoning stages on end-to-end latency, optimal batching strategies for hybrid pipelines, and the architectural implications of remote KV cache retrieval. HERMES empowers system designers to navigate the evolving landscape of LLM inference, providing actionable insights into optimizing hardware-software co-design for next-generation AI workloads.</p><p><h4>cs.AR, cs.AI, cs.DC, cs.LG</h4></p></div><hr>

Using the locality of the FILO2 optimization applications, in FILO2$^x$ several possibly unrelated solution areas are concurrently asynchronously optimized. The overall search trajectory emerges as an iteration-based parallelism obtained by the simultaneous optimization of the same underlying solution performed by several solvers. Despite the high efficiency exhibited by the single-threaded FILO2 algorithm, the computational results show that, by better exploiting the available computing resources, FILO2$^x$ can greatly enhance the resolution time compared to the original approach, still maintaining a similar final solution quality for instances ranging from hundreds to hundreds of thousands customers.</p><p><h4>cs.DC, cs.DM</h4></p></div><hr>

Zeeshan Haider, Tayyaba Noreen, M. D. Assuncao, Kaiwen Zhang</p><p>Sharding has emerged as a key technique to address blockchain scalability by partitioning the ledger into multiple shards that process transactions in parallel. Although this approach improves throughput, static or heuristic shard allocation often leads to workload skew, congestion, and excessive cross-shard communication diminishing the scalability benefits of sharding. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Predictive Shard Allocation Protocol (PSAP), a dynamic and intelligent allocation framework that proactively assigns accounts and transactions to shards based on workload forecasts. PSAP integrates a Temporal Workload Forecasting (TWF) model with a safety-constrained reinforcement learning (Safe-PPO) controller, jointly enabling multi-block-ahead prediction and adaptive shard reconfiguration. The protocol enforces deterministic inference across validators through a synchronized quantized runtime and a safety gate that limits stake concentration, migration gas, and utilization thresholds. By anticipating hotspot formation and executing bounded, atomic migrations, PSAP achieves stable load balance while preserving Byzantine safety. Experimental evaluation on heterogeneous datasets, including Ethereum, NEAR, and Hyperledger Fabric mapped via address-clustering heuristics, demonstrates up to 2x throughput improvement, 35\% lower latency, and 20\% reduced cross-shard overhead compared to existing dynamic sharding baselines. These results confirm that predictive, deterministic, and security-aware shard allocation is a promising direction for next-generation scalable blockchain systems.</p><p><h4>cs.DC</h4></p></div><hr>

However, workflow scheduling on HPC infrastructures remains challenging due to the prevalence of non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architectures. These systems require schedulers to account for data locality not only across distributed environments but also within each node. Modern HPC nodes integrate multiple NUMA domains and heterogeneous memory regions, such as high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and DRAM, and frequently attach accelerators (GPUs or FPGAs) and network interface cards (NICs) to specific NUMA nodes. This design increases the variability of data-access latency and complicates the placement of both tasks and data. Despite these constraints, most workflow scheduling strategies were originally developed for Grid or Cloud environments and rarely incorporate NUMA-aware considerations. To address this gap, this work introduces nFlows, a NUMA-aware Workflow Execution Runtime System that enables the modeling, bare-metal execution, simulation, and validation of scheduling algorithms for data-intensive workflows on NUMA-based HPC systems. The system&#x27;s design, implementation, and validation methodology are presented. nFlows supports the construction of simulation models and their direct execution on physical systems, enabling studies of NUMA effects on scheduling, the design of NUMA-aware algorithms, the analysis of data-movement behavior, the identification of performance bottlenecks, and the exploration of in-memory workflow execution.</p><p><h4>cs.DC</h4></p></div><hr>

Motivated by the empirical observations that (i) batch denoising effectively reduces per-step denoising delay by enhancing parallelism and (ii) early denoising steps have a greater impact on generation quality than later steps, we develop the STACKING algorithm to optimize batch denoising. The STACKING operates independently of any specific form of the content quality function and achieves lower computational complexity.

Existing solutions like model compression often sacrifice accuracy, while specialized hardware remains costly and inflexible. Hybrid inference methods, however, typically overlook how operator characteristics impact performance. In this work, we present SparOA, a CPU-GPU hybrid inference framework, which leverages both sparsity and computational intensity to optimize operator scheduling. SparOA embraces aforementioned challenges through three key components: (1) a threshold predictor that accurately determines optimal sparsity and computational intensity thresholds; (2) a reinforcement learning-based scheduler that dynamically optimizes resource allocation based on real-time hardware states; and (3) a hybrid inference engine that enhances efficiency through asynchronous execution and batch size optimization.Extensive results show that SparOA achieves an average speedup of 1.22-1.31x compared to all baselines, and outperforms the CPU-Only by up to 50.7x. Also, SparOA achieves optimal energy-per-inference, consuming 7\%-16\% less energy than the SOTA co-execution baseline.</p><p><h4>cs.DC, cs.AI</h4></p></div><hr>

Although high-bandwidth memory (HBM) on GPUs offers fast access, its limited capacity necessitates reliance on host memory (CPU DRAM) to support larger working sets such as the KVCache. However, the maximum DRAM capacity is constrained by the limited number of memory channels per CPU socket. To overcome this limitation, current systems often adopt RDMA-based disaggregated memory pools, which introduce significant challenges including high access latency, complex communication protocols, and synchronization overhead. Fortunately, the emerging CXL technology introduces new opportunities in KVCache design. In this paper, we propose Beluga, a novel memory architecture that enables GPUs and CPUs to access a shared, large-scale memory pool through CXL switches. By supporting native load/store access semantics over the CXL fabric, our design delivers near-local memory latency, while reducing programming complexity and minimizing synchronization overhead. We conduct a systematic characterization of a commercial CXL switch-based memory pool and propose a set of design guidelines. Based on Beluga, we design and implement Beluga-KVCache, a system tailored for managing the large-scale KVCache in LLM inference. Beluga-KVCache achieves an 89.6% reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and 7.35x throughput improvement in the vLLM inference engine compared to RDMA-based solutions. To the best of our knowledge, Beluga is the first system that enables GPUs to directly access large-scale memory pools through CXL switches, marking a significant step toward low-latency, shared access to vast memory resources by GPUs.</p><p><h4>cs.DC, cs.AI</h4></p></div><hr>

The Sun is by far the largest energy source in our solar system, and thus it warrants consideration how future AI infrastructure could most efficiently tap into that power. This work explores a scalable compute system for machine learning in space, using fleets of satellites equipped with solar arrays, inter-satellite links using free-space optics, and Google tensor processing unit (TPU) accelerator chips. To facilitate high-bandwidth, low-latency inter-satellite communication, the satellites would be flown in close proximity. We illustrate the basic approach to formation flight via a 81-satellite cluster of 1 km radius, and describe an approach for using high-precision ML-based models to control large-scale constellations. Trillium TPUs are radiation tested. They survive a total ionizing dose equivalent to a 5 year mission life without permanent failures, and are characterized for bit-flip errors. Launch costs are a critical part of overall system cost; a learning curve analysis suggests launch to low-Earth orbit (LEO) may reach $\lesssim$\$200/kg by the mid-2030s.</p><p><h4>cs.DC, cs.LG</h4></p></div><hr>

In this work, we present a federated learning framework built to run efficiently across mixed HPC and cloud environments. Our system addresses key challenges such as system het- erogeneity, communication overhead, and resource scheduling, while maintaining model accuracy and data privacy. Through experiments on a hybrid testbed, we demonstrate strong performance in terms of scalability, fault tolerance, and convergence, even under non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data distributions and varied hardware.

These agents, modelled as autonomous physical or software entities, possess local computation power, finite memory and have the ability to traverse a graph, offering efficient solutions to a range of classical problems. In this work, we focus on the problem of computing a \emph{minimal dominating set} (mDS) in anonymous graphs using mobile agents. Building on the recently proposed optimal dispersion algorithm on the synchronous mobile agent model, we design two new algorithms that achieve a \emph{linear-time} solution for this problem in the synchronous setting. Specifically, given a connected $n$-node graph with $n$ agents initially placed in either rooted or arbitrary configurations, we show that an mDS can be computed in $O(n)$ rounds using only $O(\log n)$ bits of memory per agent, without using any prior knowledge of any global parameters. This improves upon the best-known complexity results in the literature over the same model. In addition, as natural by-products of our methodology, our algorithms also construct a spanning tree and elect a unique leader in $O(n)$ rounds, which are also important results of independent interest in the mobile-agent framework.</p><p><h4>cs.DC, cs.DS, cs.MA, cs.RO</h4></p></div><hr>

While cloud-native RDBMSs provide elastic computing resources via disaggregated computing and storage, storage costs remain a critical user concern. Consequently, data compression emerges as an effective strategy to reduce storage costs. However, existing compression approaches in RDBMSs present a stark trade-off: software-based approaches incur significant performance overheads, while hardware-based alternatives lack the flexibility required for diverse database workloads. In this paper, we present PolarStore, a compressed shared storage system for cloud-native RDBMSs. PolarStore employs a dual-layer compression mechanism that combines in-storage compression in PolarCSD hardware with lightweight compression in software. This design leverages the strengths of both approaches. PolarStore also incorporates database-oriented optimizations to maintain high performance on critical I/O paths. Drawing from large-scale deployment experiences, we also introduce hardware improvements for PolarCSD to ensure host-level stability and propose a compression-aware scheduling scheme to improve cluster-level space efficiency. PolarStore is currently deployed on thousands of storage servers within PolarDB, managing over 100 PB of data. It achieves a compression ratio of 3.55 and reduces storage costs by approximately 60%. Remarkably, these savings are achieved while maintaining performance comparable to uncompressed clusters.</p><p><h4>cs.DC, cs.DB</h4></p></div><hr>

SwitchDelta uses a best-effort data plane design to overcome the resource limitation of switches and designs a novel metadata update protocol to exploit the benefits of in-network data visibility. We evaluate SwitchDelta in three distributed in-memory storage systems: log-structured key-value stores, file systems, and secondary indexes. The evaluation shows that SwitchDelta reduces the latency of write operations by up to 52.4% and boosts the throughput by up to 126.9% under write-heavy workloads.</p><p><h4>cs.DC, cs.DB</h4></p></div><hr>

While LLMs offer promise for automation, both general-purpose and finetuned LLMs suffer from two fundamental and conflicting limitations: correctness and efficiency. The key reason is that existing LLM-based approaches directly generate the entire optimized low-level programs, requiring exploration of an extremely vast space encompassing both optimization policies and implementation codes. To address the challenge of exploring an intractable space, we propose Macro Thinking Micro Coding (MTMC), a hierarchical framework inspired by the staged optimization strategy of human experts. It decouples optimization strategy from implementation details, ensuring efficiency through high-level strategy and correctness through low-level implementation. Specifically, Macro Thinking employs reinforcement learning to guide lightweight LLMs in efficiently exploring and learning semantic optimization strategies that maximize hardware utilization. Micro Coding leverages general-purpose LLMs to incrementally implement the stepwise optimization proposals from Macro Thinking, avoiding full-kernel generation errors. Together, they effectively navigate the vast optimization space and intricate implementation details, enabling LLMs for high-performance GPU kernel generation. Comprehensive results on widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of MTMC on GPU kernel generation in both accuracy and running time. On KernelBench, MTMC achieves near 100% and 70% accuracy at Levels 1-2 and 3, over 50% than SOTA general-purpose and domain-finetuned LLMs, with up to 7.3x speedup over LLMs, and 2.2x over expert-optimized PyTorch Eager kernels. On the more challenging TritonBench, MTMC attains up to 59.64% accuracy and 34x speedup.</p><p><h4>cs.DC, cs.CL</h4></p></div><hr>

Consequently, memory competition leads to inevitable page swapping in memory-constrained mixed-criticality edge devices, causing slow storage I/O and thus performance degradation. In such scenarios, inefficient memory allocation disrupts the balance between application performance, causing soft real-time (soft RT) tasks to miss deadlines or preventing non-real-time (non-RT) applications from optimizing throughput. Meanwhile, we observe unpredictable, long system-level stalls (called long stalls) under high memory and I/O pressure, which further degrade performance. In this work, we propose a Stall-Aware Real-Time Memory Allocator (SARA), which discovers opportunities for performance balance by allocating just enough memory to soft RT tasks to meet deadlines and, at the same time, optimizing the remaining memory for non-RT applications. To minimize the memory usage of soft RT tasks while meeting real-time requirements, SARA leverages our insight into how latency, caused by memory insufficiency and measured by our proposed PSI-based metric, affects the execution time of each soft RT job, where a job runs per period and a soft RT task consists of multiple periods. Moreover, SARA detects long stalls using our definition and proactively drops affected jobs, minimizing stalls in task execution. Experiments show that SARA achieves an average of 97.13% deadline hit ratio for soft RT tasks and improves non-RT application throughput by up to 22.32x over existing approaches, even with memory capacity limited to 60% of peak demand.</p><p><h4>cs.OS</h4></p></div><hr>
