### [Machine Learning-Guided Memory Optimization for DLRM Inference on Tiered Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08568)
**作者**：Jie Ren, Bin Ma, Shuangyan Yang, Benjamin Francis, Ehsan K. Ardestani, Min Si, Dong Li

Deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs) are widely used in industry, and their memory capacity requirements reach the terabyte scale. Tiered memory architectures provide a cost-effective solution but introduce challenges in embedding-vector placement due to complex embedding-access patterns. We propose RecMG, a machine learning (ML)-guided system for vector caching and prefetching on tiered memory. RecMG accurately predicts accesses to embedding vectors with long reuse distances or few reuses. The design of RecMG focuses on making ML feasible in the context of DLRM inference by addressing unique challenges in data labeling and navigating the search space for embedding-vector placement. By employing separate ML models for caching and prefetching, plus a novel differentiable loss function, RecMG narrows the prefetching search space and minimizes on-demand fetches. Compared to state-of-the-art temporal, spatial, and ML-based prefetchers, RecMG reduces on-demand fetches by 2.2x, 2.8x, and 1.5x, respectively. In industrial-scale DLRM inference scenarios, RecMG effectively reduces end-to-end DLRM inference time by up to 43%.

### [Think-at-Hard: Selective Latent Iterations to Improve Reasoning Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08577)
**作者**：Tianyu Fu, Yichen You, Zekai Chen, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang

Improving reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially under parameter constraints, is crucial for real-world applications. Prior work proposes recurrent transformers, which allocate a fixed number of extra iterations per token to improve generation quality. After the first, standard forward pass, instead of verbalization, last-layer hidden states are fed back as inputs for additional iterations to refine token predictions. Yet we identify a latent overthinking phenomenon: easy token predictions that are already correct after the first pass are sometimes revised into errors in additional iterations. To address this, we propose Think-at-Hard (TaH), a dynamic latent thinking method that iterates deeper only at hard tokens. It employs a lightweight neural decider to trigger latent iterations only at tokens that are likely incorrect after the standard forward pass. During latent iterations, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules shift the LLM objective from general next-token prediction to focused hard-token refinement. We further introduce a duo-causal attention mechanism that extends attention from the token sequence dimension to an additional iteration depth dimension. This enables cross-iteration information flow while maintaining full sequential parallelism. Experiments show that TaH boosts LLM reasoning performance across five challenging benchmarks while maintaining the same parameter count. Compared with baselines that iterate twice for all output tokens, TaH delivers 8.1-11.3% accuracy gains while exempting 94% of tokens from the second iteration. Against strong single-iteration Qwen3 models finetuned with the same data, it also delivers 4.0-5.0% accuracy gains. When allowing less than 3% additional parameters from LoRA and the iteration decider, the gains increase to 8.5-12.6% and 5.3-5.4%, respectively.

### [FractalCloud: A Fractal-Inspired Architecture for Efficient Large-Scale Point Cloud Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07665)
**作者**：Yuzhe Fu, Changchun Zhou, Hancheng Ye, Bowen Duan, Qiyu Huang, Chiyue Wei, Cong Guo, Hai "Helen'' Li, Yiran Chen

Three-dimensional (3D) point clouds are increasingly used in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and virtual reality (VR). Point-based neural networks (PNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in point cloud analysis, originally targeting small-scale inputs. However, as PNNs evolve to process large-scale point clouds with hundreds of thousands of points, all-to-all computation and global memory access in point cloud processing introduce substantial overhead, causing $O(n^2)$ computational complexity and memory traffic where n is the number of points}. Existing accelerators, primarily optimized for small-scale workloads, overlook this challenge and scale poorly due to inefficient partitioning and non-parallel architectures. To address these issues, we propose FractalCloud, a fractal-inspired hardware architecture for efficient large-scale 3D point cloud processing. FractalCloud introduces two key optimizations: (1) a co-designed Fractal method for shape-aware and hardware-friendly partitioning, and (2) block-parallel point operations that decompose and parallelize all point operations. A dedicated hardware design with on-chip fractal and flexible parallelism further enables fully parallel processing within limited memory resources. Implemented in 28 nm technology as a chip layout with a core area of 1.5 $mm^2$, FractalCloud achieves 21.7x speedup and 27x energy reduction over state-of-the-art accelerators while maintaining network accuracy, demonstrating its scalability and efficiency for PNN inference.

### [PIMfused: Near-Bank DRAM-PIM with Fused-layer Dataflow for CNN Data Transfer Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07985)
**作者**：Simei Yang, Xinyu Shi, Lu Zhao, Yunyu Ling, Quanjun Wang, Francky Catthoor

Near-bank Processing-in-Memory (PIM) architectures integrate processing cores (PIMcores) close to DRAM banks to mitigate the high cost of off-chip memory accesses. When accelerating convolutional neural network (CNN) on DRAM-PIM, performance is often constrained by cross-bank (or cross-PIMcore) data transfers, which are induced by the conventional layer-by-layer dataflow that enforces inter-bank (or inter-PIMcore) dependencies across successive CNN layers. To address this challenge, we propose PIMfused, a hardware-software co-design that enables fused-layer dataflow for end-to-end CNN execution in near-bank DRAM-PIM. By adopting fused-layer dataflow, PIMfused improves data reuse and, more importantly, breaks inter-bank data dependencies, thereby optimizing cross-bank data transfers without sacrificing bank-level parallelism. We study the impact of buffer sizes and PIMcore parallelism (1-bank vs. 4-bank) on PIMfused using end-to-end ResNet18. We present three key takeaways and show that with 4-bank PIMcores, PIMfused achieves overall PPA gains over a GDDR6-AiM-like baseline, cutting memory cycles to 30.6%, energy to 83.4%, and area to 76.5%.

### [DRACO: Co-design for DSP-Efficient Rigid Body Dynamics Accelerator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08395)
**作者**：Xingyu Liu, Jiawei Liang, Yipu Zhang, Linfeng Du, Chaofang Ma, Hui Yu, Jiang Xu, Wei Zhang

We propose a hardware-efficient RBD accelerator based on FPGA, introducing three key innovations. First, we propose a precision-aware quantization framework that reduces DSP demand while preserving motion accuracy. This is also the first study to systematically evaluate quantization impact on robot control and motion for hardware acceleration. Second, we leverage a division deferring optimization in mass matrix inversion algorithm, which decouples reciprocal operations from the longest latency path to improve the performance. Finally, we present an inter-module DSP reuse methodology to improve DSP utilization and save DSP usage. Experiment results show that our work achieves up to 8x throughput improvement and 7.4x latency reduction over state-of-the-art RBD accelerators across various robot types, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability for high-DOF robotic systems.

### [CO2-Meter: A Comprehensive Carbon Footprint Estimator for LLMs on Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08575)
**作者**：Zhenxiao Fu, Chen Fan, Lei Jiang

LLMs have transformed NLP, yet deploying them on edge devices poses great carbon challenges. Prior estimators remain incomplete, neglecting peripheral energy use, distinct prefill/decode behaviors, and SoC design complexity. This paper presents CO2-Meter, a unified framework for estimating operational and embodied carbon in LLM edge inference. Contributions include: (1) equation-based peripheral energy models and datasets; (2) a GNN-based predictor with phase-specific LLM energy data; (3) a unit-level embodied carbon model for SoC bottleneck analysis; and (4) validation showing superior accuracy over prior methods. Case studies show CO2-Meter's effectiveness in identifying carbon hotspots and guiding sustainable LLM design on edge platforms. Source code: https://github.com/fuzhenxiao/CO2-Meter

### [Re$^{\text{2}}$MaP: Macro Placement by Recursively Prototyping and Packing Tree-based Relocating](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08054)
**作者**：Yunqi Shi, Xi Lin, Zhiang Wang, Siyuan Xu, Shixiong Kai, Yao Lai, Chengrui Gao, Ke Xue, Mingxuan Yuan, Chao Qian, Zhi-Hua Zhou

This work introduces the Re$^{\text{2}}$MaP method, which generates expert-quality macro placements through recursively prototyping and packing tree-based relocating. We first perform multi-level macro grouping and PPA-aware cell clustering to produce a unified connection matrix that captures both wirelength and dataflow among macros and clusters. Next, we use DREAMPlace to build a mixed-size placement prototype and obtain reference positions for each macro and cluster. Based on this prototype, we introduce ABPlace, an angle-based analytical method that optimizes macro positions on an ellipse to distribute macros uniformly near chip periphery, while optimizing wirelength and dataflow. A packing tree-based relocating procedure is then designed to jointly adjust the locations of macro groups and the macros within each group, by optimizing an expertise-inspired cost function that captures various design constraints through evolutionary search. Re$^{\text{2}}$MaP repeats the above process: Only a subset of macro groups are positioned in each iteration, and the remaining macros are deferred to the next iteration to improve the prototype's accuracy. Using a well-established backend flow with sufficient timing optimizations, Re$^{\text{2}}$MaP achieves up to 22.22% (average 10.26%) improvement in worst negative slack (WNS) and up to 97.91% (average 33.97%) improvement in total negative slack (TNS) compared to the state-of-the-art academic placer Hier-RTLMP. It also ranks higher on WNS, TNS, power, design rule check (DRC) violations, and runtime than the conference version ReMaP, across seven tested cases.

### [BDD2Seq: Enabling Scalable Reversible-Circuit Synthesis via Graph-to-Sequence Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08315)
**作者**：Mingkai Miao, Jianheng Tang, Guangyu Hu, Hongce Zhang

Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) are instrumental in many electronic design automation (EDA) tasks thanks to their compact representation of Boolean functions. In BDD-based reversible-circuit synthesis, which is critical for quantum computing, the chosen variable ordering governs the number of BDD nodes and thus the key metrics of resource consumption, such as Quantum Cost. Because finding an optimal variable ordering for BDDs is an NP-complete problem, existing heuristics often degrade as circuit complexity grows. We introduce BDD2Seq, a graph-to-sequence framework that couples a Graph Neural Network encoder with a Pointer-Network decoder and Diverse Beam Search to predict high-quality orderings. By treating the circuit netlist as a graph, BDD2Seq learns structural dependencies that conventional heuristics overlooked, yielding smaller BDDs and faster synthesis. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks show that BDD2Seq achieves around 1.4 times lower Quantum Cost and 3.7 times faster synthesis than modern heuristic algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to tackle the variable-ordering problem in BDD-based reversible-circuit synthesis with a graph-based generative model and diversity-promoting decoding.

### [ZeroSim: Zero-Shot Analog Circuit Evaluation with Unified Transformer Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07658)
**作者**：Xiaomeng Yang, Jian Gao, Yanzhi Wang, Xuan Zhang

Although recent advancements in learning-based analog circuit design automation have tackled tasks such as topology generation, device sizing, and layout synthesis, efficient performance evaluation remains a major bottleneck. Traditional SPICE simulations are time-consuming, while existing machine learning methods often require topology-specific retraining or manual substructure segmentation for fine-tuning, hindering scalability and adaptability. In this work, we propose ZeroSim, a transformer-based performance modeling framework designed to achieve robust in-distribution generalization across trained topologies under novel parameter configurations and zero-shot generalization to unseen topologies without any fine-tuning. We apply three key enabling strategies: (1) a diverse training corpus of 3.6 million instances covering over 60 amplifier topologies, (2) unified topology embeddings leveraging global-aware tokens and hierarchical attention to robustly generalize to novel circuits, and (3) a topology-conditioned parameter mapping approach that maintains consistent structural representations independent of parameter variations. Our experimental results demonstrate that ZeroSim significantly outperforms baseline models such as multilayer perceptrons, graph neural networks and transformers, delivering accurate zero-shot predictions across different amplifier topologies. Additionally, when integrated into a reinforcement learning-based parameter optimization pipeline, ZeroSim achieves a remarkable speedup (13x) compared to conventional SPICE simulations, underscoring its practical value for a wide range of analog circuit design automation tasks.

### [Streaming Tensor Program: A streaming abstraction for dynamic parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07776)
**作者**：Gina Sohn, Genghan Zhang, Konstantin Hossfeld, Jungwoo Kim, Nathan Sobotka, Nathan Zhang, Olivia Hsu, Kunle Olukotun

Dynamic behaviors are becoming prevalent in many tensor applications. In machine learning, for example, the input tensors are dynamically shaped or ragged, and data-dependent control flow is widely used in many models. However, the limited expressiveness of prior programming abstractions for spatial dataflow accelerators forces the dynamic behaviors to be implemented statically or lacks the visibility for performance-critical decisions. To address these challenges, we present the Streaming Tensor Program (STeP), a new streaming abstraction that enables dynamic tensor workloads to run efficiently on spatial dataflow accelerators. STeP introduces flexible routing operators, an explicit memory hierarchy, and symbolic shape semantics that expose dynamic data rates and tensor dimensions. These capabilities unlock new optimizations-dynamic tiling, dynamic parallelization, and configuration time-multiplexing-that adapt to dynamic behaviors while preserving dataflow efficiency. Using a cycle-approximate simulator on representative LLM layers with real-world traces, dynamic tiling reduces on-chip memory requirement by 2.18x, dynamic parallelization improves latency by 1.5x, and configuration time-multiplexing improves compute utilization by 2.57x over implementations available in prior abstractions.

### [UniFormer: Unified and Efficient Transformer for Reasoning Across General and Custom Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08135)
**作者**：Zhuoheng Ran, Chong Wu, Renjie Xu, Maolin Che, Hong Yan

The success of neural networks such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has been largely attributed to their effective and widespread deployment on customised computing platforms, including field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). In the current era, Transformer-based architectures underpin the majority of state-of-the-art (SOTA) larger models that are also increasingly deployed on customised computing hardware for low-power and real-time applications. However, the fundamentally different parallel computation paradigms between general-purpose and customised computing often lead to compromises in model transfer and deployability, which typically come at the cost of complexity, efficiency or accuracy. Moreover, many cross-platform optimisation principles have also remained underexplored in existing studies. This paper introduces UniFormer, a unified and efficient Transformer architecture for both general-purpose and customised computing platforms. By enabling higher parallelism and compute-storage fusion, UniFormer achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy and latency on GPUs while exhibiting strong adaptability on FPGAs. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first efficient Transformer work that jointly considers both general-purpose and customised computing architectures.

### [REIS: A High-Performance and Energy-Efficient Retrieval System with In-Storage Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16444)
**作者**：Kangqi Chen, Andreas Kosmas Kakolyris, Rakesh Nadig, Manos Frouzakis, Nika Mansouri Ghiasi, Yu Liang, Haiyu Mao, Jisung Park, Mohammad Sadrosadati, Onur Mutlu

Large Language Models (LLMs) face an inherent challenge: their knowledge is confined to the data that they have been trained on. To overcome this issue, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) complements the static training-derived knowledge of LLMs with an external knowledge repository. RAG consists of three stages: indexing, retrieval, and generation. The retrieval stage of RAG becomes a significant bottleneck in inference pipelines. In this stage, a user query is mapped to an embedding vector and an Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) algorithm searches for similar vectors in the database to identify relevant items. Due to the large database sizes, ANNS incurs significant data movement overheads between the host and the storage system. To alleviate these overheads, prior works propose In-Storage Processing (ISP) techniques that accelerate ANNS by performing computations inside storage. However, existing works that leverage ISP for ANNS (i) employ algorithms that are not tailored to ISP systems, (ii) do not accelerate data retrieval operations for data selected by ANNS, and (iii) introduce significant hardware modifications, limiting performance and hindering their adoption. We propose REIS, the first ISP system tailored for RAG that addresses these limitations with three key mechanisms. First, REIS employs a database layout that links database embedding vectors to their associated documents, enabling efficient retrieval. Second, it enables efficient ANNS by introducing an ISP-tailored data placement technique that distributes embeddings across the planes of the storage system and employs a lightweight Flash Translation Layer. Third, REIS leverages an ANNS engine that uses the existing computational resources inside the storage system. Compared to a server-grade system, REIS improves the performance (energy efficiency) of retrieval by an average of 13x (55x).

### [Towards Affordable, Adaptive and Automatic GNN Training on CPU-GPU Heterogeneous Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07421)
**作者**：Tong Qiao, Ao Zhou, Yingjie Qi, Yiou Wang, Han Wan, Jianlei Yang, Chunming Hu

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely adopted due to their strong performance. However, GNN training often relies on expensive, high-performance computing platforms, limiting accessibility for many tasks. Profiling of representative GNN workloads indicates that substantial efficiency gains are possible on resource-constrained devices by fully exploiting available resources. This paper introduces A3GNN, a framework for affordable, adaptive, and automatic GNN training on heterogeneous CPU-GPU platforms. It improves resource usage through locality-aware sampling and fine-grained parallelism scheduling. Moreover, it leverages reinforcement learning to explore the design space and achieve pareto-optimal trade-offs among throughput, memory footprint, and accuracy. Experiments show that A3GNN can bridge the performance gap, allowing seven Nvidia 2080Ti GPUs to outperform two A100 GPUs by up to 1.8X in throughput with minimal accuracy loss.

### [From Attention to Disaggregation: Tracing the Evolution of LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07422)
**作者**：Madabattula Rajesh Kumar, Srinivasa Rao Aravilli, Mustafa Saify, Shashank Srivastava

The evolution of Large Language Models from the Transformer architecture to models with trillions of parameters has shifted the primary bottleneck from model training to real time inference. Deploying these massive models is a complex distributed systems challenge constrained by memory bandwidth, computational throughput, and latency requirements. LLM inference fundamentally requires solving a multi objective optimization problem to minimize latency, maximize throughput, and reduce cost. This paper explores the necessary architectural shift towards disaggregated inference, which applies distributed systems principles such as service decomposition, resource disaggregation, and workload partitioning to overcome the limitations of traditional monolithic GPU clusters. By decoupling the compute intensive prefill phase from the memory intensive decode phase into independently scalable components, this paradigm mitigates resource contention and enables independent optimization of key metrics like Time to First Token and Inter Token Latency.

### [HyProv: Hybrid Provenance Management for Scientific Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07574)
**作者**：Vasilis Bountris, Lauritz Thamsen, Ulf Leser

Provenance plays a crucial role in scientific workflow execution, for instance by providing data for failure analysis, real-time monitoring, or statistics on resource utilization for right-sizing allocations. The workflows themselves, however, become increasingly complex in terms of involved components. Furthermore, they are executed on distributed cluster infrastructures, which makes the real-time collection, integration, and analysis of provenance data challenging. Existing provenance systems struggle to balance scalability, real-time processing, online provenance analytics, and integration across different components and compute resources. Moreover, most provenance solutions are not workflow-aware; by focusing on arbitrary workloads, they miss opportunities for workflow systems where optimization and analysis can exploit the availability of a workflow specification that dictates, to some degree, task execution orders and provides abstractions for physical tasks at a logical level.  In this paper, we present HyProv, a hybrid provenance management system that combines centralized and federated paradigms to offer scalable, online, and workflow-aware queries over workflow provenance traces. HyProv uses a centralized component for efficient management of the small and stable workflow-specification-specific provenance, and complements this with federated querying over different scalable monitoring and provenance databases for the large-scale execution logs. This enables low-latency access to current execution data. Furthermore, the design supports complex provenance queries, which we exemplify for the workflow system Airflow in combination with the resource manager Kubernetes. Our experiments indicate that HyProv scales to large workflows, answers provenance queries with sub-second latencies, and adds only modest CPU and memory overhead to the cluster.

### [Generic Algorithm for Universal TDM Communication Over Inter Satellite Links](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08034)
**作者**：Miroslav Popovic, Marko Popovic, Pavle Vasiljevic, Ilija Basicevic

The original Python Testbed for Federated Learning Algorithms is a light FL framework, which provides the three generic algorithms: the centralized federated learning, the decentralized federated learning, and the TDM communication (i.e., peer data exchange) in the current time slot. The limitation of the latter is that it allows communication only between pairs of network nodes. This paper presents the new generic algorithm for the universal TDM communication that overcomes this limitation, such that a node can communicate with an arbitrary number of peers (assuming the peers also want to communicate with it). The paper covers: (i) the algorithm's theoretical foundation, (ii) the system design, and (iii) the system validation. The main advantage of the new algorithm is that it supports real-world TDM communications over inter satellite links.

### [\uline{LO}w-c\uline{O}st yet High-\uline{P}erformant \uline{S}parse Matrix-Matrix Multiplication on Arm SME Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08158)
**作者**：Kelun Lei, Hailong Yang, Kaige Zhang, Kejie Ma, Yiqing Wang, Xin You, Yufan Xu, Enrique S. Quintana-Orti, Zhongzhi Luan, Yi Liu, Depei Qian

Sparse matrix-dense matrix multiplication (SpMM) is a critical kernel in both scientific computing and emerging graph learning workloads. The recent Armv9 architecture introduces Scalable Matrix Extension (SME), enabling tile-based matrix operations with high throughput. However, effectively exploiting both SME and traditional SIMD resources for unstructured sparse workloads remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose LOOPS, a hybrid execution framework that combines row-wise CSR-part with vector-wise BCSR-part layout, enabling cooperative utilization of vector instructions (NEON) and Scalable Matrix Extension (SME) resources. LOOPS supports multi-precision SpMM across FP64, FP32, and FP16 via an adaptive two-level parallelization scheme guided by a lightweight performance model. Experimental results on the entire SuiteSparse on an Apple's M4Pro CPU show that LOOPS achieves average speedups of 9.93$\times$ (FP32)/14.4$\times$ (FP64) against the CPU baseline TACO and 71.3$\times$ (FP32)/54.8$\times$ (FP64) with respect to Armadillo. A comparison of LOOPS running on the same CPU with two GPU methods (cuSPARSE, Magicube) executed on an NVIDIA A100 GPU show average speedups for LOOPS between 19.8$\times$ and 33.5$\times$, depending on the precision. Notably, LOOPS delivers significantly better energy efficiency than the GPU codes on the A100 GPU.

### [Gathering in Vertex- and Edge-Transitive Graphs without Multiplicity Detection under Round Robin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08222)
**作者**：Serafino Cicerone, Alessia Di Fonso, Gabriele Di Stefano, Alfredo Navarra

In the field of swarm robotics, one of the most studied problem is Gathering. It asks for a distributed algorithm that brings the robots to a common location, not known in advance. We consider the case of robots constrained to move along the edges of a graph under the well-known OBLOT model. Gathering is then accomplished once all the robots occupy a same vertex. Differently from classical settings, we assume: i) the initial configuration may contain multiplicities, i.e. more than one robot may occupy the same vertex; ii) robots cannot detect multiplicities; iii) robots move along the edges of vertex- and edge-transitive graphs, i.e. graphs where all the vertices (and the edges, resp.) belong to a same class of equivalence. To balance somehow such a `hostile' setting, as a scheduler for the activation of the robots, we consider the round-robin, where robots are cyclically activated one at a time.  We provide some basic impossibility results and we design two different algorithms approaching the Gathering for robots moving on two specific topologies belonging to edge- and vertex-transitive graphs: infinite grids and hypercubes. The two algorithms are both time-optimal and heavily exploit the properties of the underlying topologies. Because of this, we conjecture that no general algorithm can exist for all the solvable cases.

### [Priority Matters: Optimising Kubernetes Clusters Usage with Constraint-Based Pod Packing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08373)
**作者**：Henrik Daniel Christensen, Saverio Giallorenzo, Jacopo Mauro

Distributed applications employ Kubernetes for scalable, fault-tolerant deployments over computer clusters, where application components run in groups of containers called pods. The scheduler, at the heart of Kubernetes' architecture, determines the placement of pods given their priority and resource requirements on cluster nodes. To quickly allocate pods, the scheduler uses lightweight heuristics that can lead to suboptimal placements and resource fragmentation, preventing allocations of otherwise deployable pods on the available nodes.  We propose the usage of constraint programming to find the optimal allocation of pods satisfying all their priorities and resource requests. Implementation-wise, our solution comes as a plug-in to the default scheduler that operates as a fallback mechanism when some pods cannot be allocated. Using the OR-Tools constraint solver, our experiments on small-to-mid-sized clusters indicate that, within a 1-second scheduling window, our approach places more higher-priority pods than the default scheduler (possibly demonstrating allocation optimality) in over 44\% of realisable allocation scenarios where the default scheduler fails, while certifying that the default scheduler's placement is already optimal in over 19\% of scenarios. With a 10-second window, our approach improves placements in over 73\% and still certifies that the default scheduler's placement is already optimal in over 19\% of scenarios.

### [Synera: Synergistic LLM Serving across Device and Cloud at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07423)
**作者**：Genglin Wang, Liekang Zeng, Bufang Yang, Kaiwei Liu, Guoliang Xing, Chumin Sun, Li Zhou, Jie Sun, Zhenyu Yan

Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming key components in various mobile operating systems, driving smart applications like interactive chatbots and personal assistants. While bringing enhanced intelligence to mobile ends, their deployment suffers from a set of performance challenges, especially the generation quality degradation and prolonged latency. Prior works have mainly relied on solutions of cloud offloading or on-device Small Language Models (SLMs). However, the former is usually limited by the communication bottleneck, and the latter sacrifices generation quality due to resource constraints. To mitigate these limitations, this paper proposes Synera, a device-cloud synergistic LLM serving system that applies an efficient SLM-LLM synergistic mechanism. Through empirical studies on LLM's unique computing characteristics, Synera identifies a set of underexplored optimization opportunities in device-cloud synergistic LLM inference, including offloading decisions, pipeline stalls, and batching bottlenecks. To translate them into enhanced performance, Synera introduces tailored designs of communication-efficient selective offloading, stall-free parallel inference, and scalable cloud batching. Extensive evaluations with real-world testbeds show that Synera enables 1.20-5.47x better generation quality against competitive baselines with on-par latency performance. Compared with existing cloud serving, Synera achieves 8.2-16.5% lower cloud serving cost on various benchmarks.

### [Enhancing reliability in AI inference services: An empirical study on real production incidents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07424)
**作者**：Bhala Ranganathan, Mickey Zhang, Kai Wu

Hyperscale large language model (LLM) inference places extraordinary demands on cloud systems, where even brief failures can translate into significant user and business impact. To better understand and mitigate these risks, we present one of the first provider-internal, practice-based analysis of LLM inference incidents. We developed a taxonomy and methodology grounded in a year of operational experience, validating it on 156 high-severity incidents, and conducted a focused quantitative study of Apr-Jun 2025 to ensure recency and relevance. Our approach achieves high labeling consistency (Cohen's K ~0.89), identifies dominant failure modes (in our dataset ~60% inference engine failures, within that category ~40% timeouts), and surfaces mitigation levers (~74% auto-detected; ~28% required hotfix). Beyond hotfixes, many incidents were mitigated via traffic routing, node rebalancing, or capacity increase policies, indicating further automation opportunities. We also show how the taxonomy guided targeted strategies such as connection liveness, GPU capacity-aware routing, and per-endpoint isolation and reduced incident impact and accelerated recovery. Finally, we contribute a practitioner-oriented adoption checklist that enables others to replicate our taxonomy, analysis, and automation opportunities in their own systems. This study demonstrates how systematic, empirically grounded analysis of inference operations can drive more reliable and cost-efficient LLM serving at scale.

### [An Evaluation of LLMs Inference on Popular Single-board Computers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07425)
**作者**：Tung (Thomas),  Nguyen, Tuyen Nguyen

The growing demand for on-device large language model (LLM) inference is driving interest in deploying lightweight, cost-effective AI solutions on edge hardware. Single-board computers (SBCs) such as the Raspberry Pi and Orange Pi offer a promising platform for localized, privacy-preserving inference-but remain underexplored in the context of LLM workloads. In this work, we benchmark the performance of 25 quantized open-source LLMs across three SBCs-Raspberry Pi 4, Raspberry Pi 5, and Orange Pi 5 Pro-using two inference runtimes: Ollama and Llamafile. We evaluate generation throughput, memory usage, and power consumption under varying CPU configurations, using multiple prompt types to simulate realistic workloads. Our results show that SBCs can reliably support models up to 1.5B parameters, with Llamafile achieving up to 4x higher throughput and 30-40% lower power usage than Ollama. We identify architecture-specific bottlenecks, highlight runtime-level trade-offs, and provide practical deployment recommendations. This study offers the first broad evaluation of LLM inference on SBCs, bridging the gap between high-performance language models and affordable edge computing.

### [DynaKV: Enabling Accurate and Efficient Long-Sequence LLM Decoding on Smartphones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07427)
**作者**：Tuowei Wang, Minxing Huang, Fengzu Li, Ligeng Chen, Jinrui Zhang, Ju Ren

As the demand for human-like reasoning, multi-turn dialogues, and long-form responses grows, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to support efficient and effective long-sequence decoding. However, due to limited DRAM capacity, long-seuqence LLM decoding on smartphones is constrained by the key-value cache (KVCache), whose memory footprint increases linearly with sequence length. Retrieval-based methods mitigate DRAM pressure by offloading KVCache to flash and retrieving query-relevant entries through cluster-based indexing. Unfortunately, as decoding progresses, KVCache distribution shifts render static or local cluster updates progressively misaligned, excluding essential entries or fetching redundant ones. These issues are further exacerbated by smartphone-specific limitations in bandwidth, IOPS, and memory capacity.  We propose DynaKV, the first adaptive KVCache management approach that jointly addresses accuracy and efficiency for long-sequence decoding on smartphones. DynaKV integrates three key techniques: (1) Migration-Free Cluster Adaptation, which adaptively splits clusters during retrieval without incurring additional transfers; (2) Continuity-Centric Flash Management, which co-locates correlated entries and clusters and employs a dual-head layout for efficient updates; and (3) Memory-Efficient Cache Design, which virtualizes cache space across DRAM and flash and extends replacement policies to align with cluster-level access patterns. Evaluations demonstrate that DynaKV improves retrieval accuracy and reduces end-to-end latency compared to state-of-the-art solutions, achieving average gains of $1.38\times$ in accuracy and $1.47\times$ speedups. Furthermore, the insights of DynaKV naturally extend to other long-context workloads and multi-tier memory hierarchies, underscoring its broader applicability.

### [ProbSelect: Stochastic Client Selection for GPU-Accelerated Compute Devices in the 3D Continuum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08147)
**作者**：Andrija Stanisic, Stefan Nastic

Integration of edge, cloud and space devices into a unified 3D continuum imposes significant challenges for client selection in federated learning systems. Traditional approaches rely on continuous monitoring and historical data collection, which becomes impractical in dynamic environments where satellites and mobile devices frequently change operational conditions. Furthermore, existing solutions primarily consider CPU-based computation, failing to capture complex characteristics of GPU-accelerated training that is prevalent across the 3D continuum. This paper introduces ProbSelect, a novel approach utilizing analytical modeling and probabilistic forecasting for client selection on GPU-accelerated devices, without requiring historical data or continuous monitoring. We model client selection within user-defined SLOs. Extensive evaluation across diverse GPU architectures and workloads demonstrates that ProbSelect improves SLO compliance by 13.77% on average while achieving 72.5% computational waste reduction compared to baseline approaches.

### [Network and Systems Performance Characterization of MCP-Enabled LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07426)
**作者**：Zihao Ding, Mufeng Zhu, Yao Liu

Model Context Protocol (MCP) has recently gained increased attention within the AI community for providing a standardized way for large language models (LLMs) to interact with external tools and services, significantly enhancing their capabilities. However, the inclusion of extensive contextual information, including system prompts, MCP tool definitions, and context histories, in MCP-enabled LLM interactions, dramatically inflates token usage. Given that LLM providers charge based on tokens, these expanded contexts can quickly escalate monetary costs and increase the computational load on LLM services. This paper presents a comprehensive measurement-based analysis of MCP-enabled interactions with LLMs, revealing trade-offs between capability, performance, and cost. We explore how different LLM models and MCP configurations impact key performance metrics such as token efficiency, monetary cost, task completion times, and task success rates, and suggest potential optimizations, including enabling parallel tool calls and implementing robust task abort mechanisms. These findings provide useful insights for developing more efficient, robust, and cost-effective MCP-enabled workflows.

### [Intelligence per Watt: Measuring Intelligence Efficiency of Local AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07885)

Large language model (LLM) queries are predominantly processed by frontier models in centralized cloud infrastructure. Rapidly growing demand strains this paradigm, and cloud providers struggle to scale infrastructure at pace. Two advances enable us to rethink this paradigm: small LMs (<=20B active parameters) now achieve competitive performance to frontier models on many tasks, and local accelerators (e.g., Apple M4 Max) run these models at interactive latencies. This raises the question: can local inference viably redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure? Answering this requires measuring whether local LMs can accurately answer real-world queries and whether they can do so efficiently enough to be practical on power-constrained devices (i.e., laptops). We propose intelligence per watt (IPW), task accuracy divided by unit of power, as a metric for assessing capability and efficiency of local inference across model-accelerator pairs. We conduct a large-scale empirical study across 20+ state-of-the-art local LMs, 8 accelerators, and a representative subset of LLM traffic: 1M real-world single-turn chat and reasoning queries. For each query, we measure accuracy, energy, latency, and power. Our analysis reveals $3$ findings. First, local LMs can accurately answer 88.7% of single-turn chat and reasoning queries with accuracy varying by domain. Second, from 2023-2025, IPW improved 5.3x and local query coverage rose from 23.2% to 71.3%. Third, local accelerators achieve at least 1.4x lower IPW than cloud accelerators running identical models, revealing significant headroom for optimization. These findings demonstrate that local inference can meaningfully redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure, with IPW serving as the critical metric for tracking this transition. We release our IPW profiling harness for systematic intelligence-per-watt benchmarking.

### [SemanticForge: Repository-Level Code Generation through Semantic Knowledge Graphs and Constraint Satisfaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07584)
**作者**：Wuyang Zhang, Chenkai Zhang, Zhen Luo, Jianming Ma, Wangming Yuan, Chuqiao Gu, Chenwei Feng

Large language models (LLMs) have transformed software development by enabling automated code generation, yet they frequently suffer from systematic errors that limit practical deployment. We identify two critical failure modes: \textit{logical hallucination} (incorrect control/data-flow reasoning) and \textit{schematic hallucination} (type mismatches, signature violations, and architectural inconsistencies). These errors stem from the absence of explicit, queryable representations of repository-wide semantics.  This paper presents \textbf{SemanticForge}, which introduces four fundamental algorithmic advances for semantically-aware code generation: (1) a novel automatic reconciliation algorithm for dual static-dynamic knowledge graphs, unifying compile-time and runtime program semantics; (2) a neural approach that learns to generate structured graph queries from natural language, achieving 73\% precision versus 51\% for traditional retrieval; (3) a novel beam search algorithm with integrated SMT solving, enabling real-time constraint verification during generation rather than post-hoc validation; and (4) an incremental maintenance algorithm that updates knowledge graphs in $O(|\Delta R| \cdot \log n)$ time while maintaining semantic equivalence.

### [Parallel Sampling via Autospeculation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07869)
**作者**：Nima Anari, Carlo Baronio, CJ Chen, Alireza Haqi, Frederic Koehler, Anqi Li, Thuy-Duong Vuong

We present parallel algorithms to accelerate sampling via counting in two settings: any-order autoregressive models and denoising diffusion models. An any-order autoregressive model accesses a target distribution $\mu$ on $[q]^n$ through an oracle that provides conditional marginals, while a denoising diffusion model accesses a target distribution $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ through an oracle that provides conditional means under Gaussian noise. Standard sequential sampling algorithms require $\widetilde{O}(n)$ time to produce a sample from $\mu$ in either setting. We show that, by issuing oracle calls in parallel, the expected sampling time can be reduced to $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/2})$. This improves the previous $\widetilde{O}(n^{2/3})$ bound for any-order autoregressive models and yields the first parallel speedup for diffusion models in the high-accuracy regime, under the relatively mild assumption that the support of $\mu$ is bounded.  We introduce a novel technique to obtain our results: speculative rejection sampling. This technique leverages an auxiliary ``speculative'' distribution~$\nu$ that approximates~$\mu$ to accelerate sampling. Our technique is inspired by the well-studied ``speculative decoding'' techniques popular in large language models, but differs in key ways. Firstly, we use ``autospeculation,'' namely we build the speculation $\nu$ out of the same oracle that defines~$\mu$. In contrast, speculative decoding typically requires a separate, faster, but potentially less accurate ``draft'' model $\nu$. Secondly, the key differentiating factor in our technique is that we make and accept speculations at a ``sequence'' level rather than at the level of single (or a few) steps. This last fact is key to unlocking our parallel runtime of $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/2})$.

### [ACGraph: An Efficient Asynchronous Out-of-Core Graph Processing Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07886)
**作者**：Dechuang Chen, Sibo Wang, Qintian Guo

Graphs are a ubiquitous data structure in diverse domains such as machine learning, social networks, and data mining. As real-world graphs continue to grow beyond the memory capacity of single machines, out-of-core graph processing systems have emerged as a viable solution. Yet, existing systems that rely on strictly synchronous, iteration-by-iteration execution incur significant overheads. In particular, their scheduling mechanisms lead to I/O inefficiencies, stemming from read and work amplification, and induce costly synchronization stalls hindering sustained disk utilization. To overcome these limitations, we present {\em ACGraph}, a novel asynchronous graph processing system optimized for SSD-based environments with constrained memory resources. ACGraph employs a dynamic, block-centric priority scheduler that adjusts in real time based on workload, along with an online asynchronous worklist that minimizes redundant disk accesses by efficiently reusing active blocks in memory. Moreover, ACGraph unifies asynchronous I/O with computation in a pipelined execution model that maintains sustained I/O activation, and leverages a highly optimized hybrid storage format to expedite access to low-degree vertices. We implement popular graph algorithms, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Weakly Connected Components (WCC), personalized PageRank (PPR), PageRank (PR), and $k$-core on ACGraph and demonstrate that ACGraph substantially outperforms state-of-the-art out-of-core graph processing systems in both runtime and I/O efficiency.

### [Foam Segmentation in Wastewater Treatment Plants: A Federated Learning Approach with Segment Anything Model 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08130)
**作者**：Mehmet Batuhan Duman, Alejandro Carnero, Cristian Mart\'in, Daniel Garrido, Manuel D\'iaz

Foam formation in Wastewater Treatment Plants (WTPs) is a major challenge that can reduce treatment efficiency and increase costs. The ability to automatically examine changes in real-time with respect to the percentage of foam can be of great benefit to the plant. However, large amounts of labeled data are required to train standard Machine Learning (ML) models. The development of these systems is slow due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of labeled data. Additionally, the development is often hindered by the fact that different WTPs do not share their data due to privacy concerns. This paper proposes a new framework to address these challenges by combining Federated Learning (FL) with the state-of-the-art base model for image segmentation, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). The FL paradigm enables collaborative model training across multiple WTPs without centralizing sensitive operational data, thereby ensuring privacy. The framework accelerates training convergence and improves segmentation performance even with limited local datasets by leveraging SAM2's strong pre-trained weights for initialization. The methodology involves fine-tuning SAM2 on distributed clients (edge nodes) using the Flower framework, where a central Fog server orchestrates the process by aggregating model weights without accessing private data. The model was trained and validated using various data collections, including real-world images captured at a WTPs in Granada, Spain, a synthetically generated foam dataset, and images from publicly available datasets to improve generalization. This research offers a practical, scalable, and privacy-aware solution for automatic foam tracking in WTPs. The findings highlight the significant potential of integrating large-scale foundational models into FL systems to solve real-world industrial challenges characterized by distributed and sensitive data.

### [BIPPO: Budget-Aware Independent PPO for Energy-Efficient Federated Learning Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08142)
**作者**：Anna Lackinger, Andrea Morichetta, Pantelis A. Frangoudis, Schahram Dustdar

Federated Learning (FL) is a promising machine learning solution in large-scale IoT systems, guaranteeing load distribution and privacy. However, FL does not natively consider infrastructure efficiency, a critical concern for systems operating in resource-constrained environments. Several Reinforcement Learning (RL) based solutions offer improved client selection for FL; however, they do not consider infrastructure challenges, such as resource limitations and device churn. Furthermore, the training of RL methods is often not designed for practical application, as these approaches frequently do not consider generalizability and are not optimized for energy efficiency. To fill this gap, we propose BIPPO (Budget-aware Independent Proximal Policy Optimization), which is an energy-efficient multi-agent RL solution that improves performance. We evaluate BIPPO on two image classification tasks run in a highly budget-constrained setting, with FL clients training on non-IID data, a challenging context for vanilla FL. The improved sampler of BIPPO enables it to increase the mean accuracy compared to non-RL mechanisms, traditional PPO, and IPPO. In addition, BIPPO only consumes a negligible proportion of the budget, which stays consistent even if the number of clients increases. Overall, BIPPO delivers a performant, stable, scalable, and sustainable solution for client selection in IoT-FL.

### [Work-in-Progress: Function-as-Subtask API Replacing Publish/Subscribe for OS-Native DAG Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08297)
**作者**：Takahiro Ishikawa-Aso, Atsushi Yano, Yutaro Kobayashi, Takumi Jin, Yuuki Takano, Shinpei Kato

The Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) task model for real-time scheduling finds its primary practical target in Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2). However, ROS 2's publish/subscribe API leaves DAG precedence constraints unenforced: a callback may publish mid-execution, and multi-input callbacks let developers choose topic-matching policies. Thus preserving DAG semantics relies on conventions; once violated, the model collapses. We propose the Function-as-Subtask (FasS) API, which expresses each subtask as a function whose arguments/return values are the subtask's incoming/outgoing edges. By minimizing description freedom, DAG semantics is guaranteed at the API rather than by programmer discipline. We implement a DAG-native scheduler using FasS on a Rust-based experimental kernel and evaluate its semantic fidelity, and we outline design guidelines for applying FasS to Linux Linux sched_ext.

### [Integrating Artificial Intelligence into Operating Systems: A Survey on Techniques, Applications, and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14567)
**作者**：Yifan Zhang, Xinkui Zhao, Ziying Li, Guanjie Cheng, Jianwei Yin, Lufei Zhang, Zuoning Chen

Heterogeneous hardware and dynamic workloads worsen long-standing OS bottlenecks in scalability, adaptability, and manageability. At the same time, advances in machine learning (ML), large language models (LLMs), and agent-based methods enable automation and self-optimization, but current efforts lack a unifying view. This survey reviews techniques, architectures, applications, challenges, and future directions at the AI-OS intersection. We chart the shift from heuristic- and rule-based designs to AI-enhanced systems, outlining the strengths of ML, LLMs, and agents across the OS stack. We summarize progress in AI for OS (core components and the wider ecosystem) and in OS for AI (component- and architecture-level support for short- and long-context inference, distributed training, and edge inference). For practice, we consolidate evaluation dimensions, methodological pipelines, and patterns that balance real-time constraints with predictive accuracy. We identify key challenges, such as complexity, overhead, model drift, limited explainability, and privacy and safety risks, and recommend modular, AI-ready kernel interfaces; unified toolchains and benchmarks; hybrid rules-plus-AI decisions with guardrails; and verifiable in-kernel inference. Finally, we propose a three-stage roadmap including AI-powered, AI-refactored, and AI-driven OSs, to bridge prototypes and production and to enable scalable, reliable AI deployment.
