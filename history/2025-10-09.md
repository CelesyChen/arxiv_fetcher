**作者**：Baraq Lipshitz (ETH Zurich), Alessio Melone (ETH Zurich), Charalampos Maraziaris (ETH Zurich), Muhammed Bilal (ETH Zurich)

Sparse Ternary General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) remains under-optimized in existing libraries for Apple Silicon CPUs. We present a Sparse Ternary GEMM kernel optimized specifically for Apple's M-series processors. We propose a set of architecture-aware optimizations, including a novel blocked and interleaved sparse data format to improve memory locality, strategies to increase Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP), and NEON-based Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) vectorization to exploit data-level parallelism. Our scalar implementation achieves up to a 5.98x performance increase over a traditional Ternary Compressed Sparse Column (TCSC) baseline for large matrices with 50% ternary nonzero values (sparsity), reaching up to a 50.2% of the processor's theoretical peak performance, and remains stable across varying sparsity levels. Our vectorized implementation delivers up to a 5.59x performance increase for large matrices with 25% sparsity, and remains stable across varying sparsity levels.

### [Adaptive Protein Design Protocols and Middleware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06396)
**作者**：Aymen Alsaadi, Jonathan Ash, Mikhail Titov, Matteo Turilli, Andre Merzky, Shantenu Jha, Sagar Khare

Computational protein design is experiencing a transformation driven by AI/ML. However, the range of potential protein sequences and structures is astronomically vast, even for moderately sized proteins. Hence, achieving convergence between generated and predicted structures demands substantial computational resources for sampling. The Integrated Machine-learning for Protein Structures at Scale (IMPRESS) offers methods and advanced computing systems for coupling AI to high-performance computing tasks, enabling the ability to evaluate the effectiveness of protein designs as they are developed, as well as the models and simulations used to generate data and train models. This paper introduces IMPRESS and demonstrates the development and implementation of an adaptive protein design protocol and its supporting computing infrastructure. This leads to increased consistency in the quality of protein design and enhanced throughput of protein design due to dynamic resource allocation and asynchronous workload execution.

### [Vectorized FlashAttention with Low-cost Exponential Computation in RISC-V Vector Processors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06834)
**作者**：Vasileios Titopoulos, Kosmas Alexandridis, Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos

Attention is a core operation in numerous machine learning and artificial intelligence models. This work focuses on the acceleration of attention kernel using FlashAttention algorithm, in vector processors, particularly those based on the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA). This work represents the first effort to vectorize FlashAttention, minimizing scalar code and simplifying the computational complexity of evaluating exponentials needed by softmax used in attention. By utilizing a low-cost approximation for exponentials in floating-point arithmetic, we reduce the cost of computing the exponential function without the need to extend baseline vector ISA with new custom instructions. Also, appropriate tiling strategies are explored with the goal to improve memory locality. Experimental results highlight the scalability of our approach, demonstrating significant performance gains with the vectorized implementations when processing attention layers in practical applications.

### [Multi-Dimensional Autoscaling of Stream Processing Services on Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06882)
**作者**：Boris Sedlak, Philipp Raith, Andrea Morichetta, V\'ictor Casamayor Pujol, Schahram Dustdar

Edge devices have limited resources, which inevitably leads to situations where stream processing services cannot satisfy their needs. While existing autoscaling mechanisms focus entirely on resource scaling, Edge devices require alternative ways to sustain the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) of competing services. To address these issues, we introduce a Multi-dimensional Autoscaling Platform (MUDAP) that supports fine-grained vertical scaling across both service- and resource-level dimensions. MUDAP supports service-specific scaling tailored to available parameters, e.g., scale data quality or model size for a particular service. To optimize the execution across services, we present a scaling agent based on Regression Analysis of Structural Knowledge (RASK). The RASK agent efficiently explores the solution space and learns a continuous regression model of the processing environment for inferring optimal scaling actions. We compared our approach with two autoscalers, the Kubernetes VPA and a reinforcement learning agent, for scaling up to 9 services on a single Edge device. Our results showed that RASK can infer an accurate regression model in merely 20 iterations (i.e., observe 200s of processing). By increasingly adding elasticity dimensions, RASK sustained the highest request load with 28% less SLO violations, compared to baselines.

### [GROMACS Unplugged: How Power Capping and Frequency Shapes Performance on GPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06902)
**作者**：Ayesha Afzal, Anna Kahler, Georg Hager, Gerhard Wellein

Molecular dynamics simulations are essential tools in computational biophysics, but their performance depend heavily on hardware choices and configuration. In this work, we presents a comprehensive performance analysis of four NVIDIA GPU accelerators -- A40, A100, L4, and L40 -- using six representative GROMACS biomolecular workloads alongside two synthetic benchmarks: Pi Solver (compute bound) and STREAM Triad (memory bound). We investigate how performance scales with GPU graphics clock frequency and how workloads respond to power capping. The two synthetic benchmarks define the extremes of frequency scaling: Pi Solver shows ideal compute scalability, while STREAM Triad reveals memory bandwidth limits -- framing GROMACS's performance in context. Our results reveal distinct frequency scaling behaviors: Smaller GROMACS systems exhibit strong frequency sensitivity, while larger systems saturate quickly, becoming increasingly memory bound. Under power capping, performance remains stable until architecture- and workload-specific thresholds are reached, with high-end GPUs like the A100 maintaining near-maximum performance even under reduced power budgets. Our findings provide practical guidance for selecting GPU hardware and optimizing GROMACS performance for large-scale MD workflows under power constraints.

### [Exchangeability in Neural Network and its Application to Dynamic Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02210)
**作者**：Pu (Luke),  Yi, Tianlang Chen, Yifan Yang, Sara Achour

Modern neural networks (NN) contain an ever-growing number of parameters, substantially increasing the memory and computational cost of inference. Researchers have explored various ways to reduce the inference cost of NNs by reducing the model size before deployment and dynamically pruning the inference computation at runtime. In this work, we present ExPrune, a general, dynamic pruning optimization that enables multi-granularity partial computation on a per-input basis. ExPrune requires no change to the model architecture or the training algorithm. ExPrune is based on our theoretical results that the relationship between certain model parameters and intermediate values can be described by a statistical property called exchangeability. By identifying exchangeable parameters and values in the model, we are able to first partially evaluate the network, analyze the statistics of the partial results, and make pruning decisions on the fly. Because ExPrune is theory grounded, it generalizes across model architectures in different problem domains. We evaluate ExPrune on one computer vision models, one graph model and one language model. ExPrune provides 10.98--17.33% reduction in FLOPs with negligible accuracy drop and 21.61--27.16% reduction in FLOPs with at most 1% accuracy drop. We also demonstrate that ExPrune composes with static magnitude pruning. On models that have been aggressively statically pruned, ExPrune still provides additional 10.24--11.11% reduction in FLOPs with negligible accuracy drop and 13.91--14.39% reduction in FLOPs with at most 1% accuracy drop.

### [On-Package Memory with Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe): A Low Power, High Bandwidth, Low Latency and Low Cost Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06513)
**作者**：Debendra Das Sharma, Swadesh Choudhary, Peter Onufryk, Rob Pelt

Emerging computing applications such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) are facing a memory wall with existing on-package memory solutions that are unable to meet the power-efficient bandwidth demands. We propose to enhance UCIe with memory semantics to deliver power-efficient bandwidth and cost-effective on-package memory solutions applicable across the entire computing continuum. We propose approaches by reusing existing LPDDR6 and HBM memory through a logic die that connects to the SoC using UCIe. We also propose an approach where the DRAM die natively supports UCIe instead of the LPDDR6 bus interface. Our approaches result in significantly higher bandwidth density (up to 10x), lower latency (up to 3x), lower power (up to 3x), and lower cost compared to existing HBM4 and LPDDR on-package memory solutions.

### [RTGS: Real-Time 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM via Multi-Level Redundancy Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06644)
**作者**：Leshu Li (Kevin), Jiayin Qin (Kevin), Jie Peng (Kevin), Zishen Wan (Kevin), Huaizhi Qu (Kevin), Ye Han (Kevin), Pingqing Zheng (Kevin), Hongsen Zhang (Kevin),  Yu (Kevin),  Cao (Katie), Tianlong Chen (Katie),  Yang (Katie),  Zhao

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems can largely benefit from 3DGS's state-of-the-art rendering efficiency and accuracy, but have not yet been adopted in resource-constrained edge devices due to insufficient speed. Addressing this, we identify notable redundancies across the SLAM pipeline for acceleration. While conceptually straightforward, practical approaches are required to minimize the overhead associated with identifying and eliminating these redundancies. In response, we propose RTGS, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework that comprehensively reduces the redundancies for real-time 3DGS-SLAM on edge. To minimize the overhead, RTGS fully leverages the characteristics of the 3DGS-SLAM pipeline. On the algorithm side, we introduce (1) an adaptive Gaussian pruning step to remove the redundant Gaussians by reusing gradients computed during backpropagation; and (2) a dynamic downsampling technique that directly reuses the keyframe identification and alpha computing steps to eliminate redundant pixels. On the hardware side, we propose (1) a subtile-level streaming strategy and a pixel-level pairwise scheduling strategy that mitigates workload imbalance via a Workload Scheduling Unit (WSU) guided by previous iteration information; (2) a Rendering and Backpropagation (R&amp;B) Buffer that accelerates the rendering backpropagation by reusing intermediate data computed during rendering; and (3) a Gradient Merging Unit (GMU) to reduce intensive memory accesses caused by atomic operations while enabling pipelined aggregation. Integrated into an edge GPU, RTGS achieves real-time performance (>= 30 FPS) on four datasets and three algorithms, with up to 82.5x energy efficiency over the baseline and negligible quality loss.

### [Hardware-Efficient CNNs: Interleaved Approximate FP32 Multipliers for Kernel Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06767)
**作者**：Bindu G Gowda (International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore), Yogesh Goyal (International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore), Yash Gupta (International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore), Madhav Rao (International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore)

Single-precision floating point (FP32) data format, defined by the IEEE 754 standard, is widely employed in scientific computing, signal processing, and deep learning training, where precision is critical. However, FP32 multiplication is computationally expensive and requires complex hardware, especially for precisely handling mantissa multiplication. In practical applications like neural network inference, perfect accuracy is not always necessary, minor multiplication errors often have little impact on final accuracy. This enables trading precision for gains in area, power, and speed. This work focuses on CNN inference using approximate FP32 multipliers, where the mantissa multiplication is approximated by employing error-variant approximate compressors, that significantly reduce hardware cost. Furthermore, this work optimizes CNN performance by employing differently approximated FP32 multipliers and studying their impact when interleaved within the kernels across the convolutional layers. The placement and ordering of these approximate multipliers within each kernel are carefully optimized using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II, balancing the trade-off between accuracy and hardware efficiency.

### [Cocoon: A System Architecture for Differentially Private Training with Correlated Noises](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07304)
**作者**：Donghwan Kim, Xin Gu, Jinho Baek, Timothy Lo, Younghoon Min, Kwangsik Shin, Jongryool Kim, Jongse Park, Kiwan Maeng

Machine learning (ML) models memorize and leak training data, causing serious privacy issues to data owners. Training algorithms with differential privacy (DP), such as DP-SGD, have been gaining attention as a solution. However, DP-SGD adds a noise at each training iteration, which degrades the accuracy of the trained model. To improve accuracy, a new family of approaches adds carefully designed correlated noises, so that noises cancel out each other across iterations. We performed an extensive characterization study of these new mechanisms, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, and show they incur non-negligible overheads when the model is large or uses large embedding tables. Motivated by the analysis, we propose Cocoon, a hardware-software co-designed framework for efficient training with correlated noises. Cocoon accelerates models with embedding tables through pre-computing and storing correlated noises in a coalesced format (Cocoon-Emb), and supports large models through a custom near-memory processing device (Cocoon-NMP). On a real system with an FPGA-based NMP device prototype, Cocoon improves the performance by 2.33-10.82x(Cocoon-Emb) and 1.55-3.06x (Cocoon-NMP).

### [Evaluating Rapid Makespan Predictions for Heterogeneous Systems with Programmable Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06998)
**作者**：Martin Wilhelm, Franz Freitag, Max Tzschoppe, Thilo Pionteck

Heterogeneous computing systems, which combine general-purpose processors with specialized accelerators, are increasingly important for optimizing the performance of modern applications. A central challenge is to decide which parts of an application should be executed on which accelerator or, more generally, how to map the tasks of an application to available devices. Predicting the impact of a change in a task mapping on the overall makespan is non-trivial. While there are very capable simulators, these generally require a full implementation of the tasks in question, which is particularly time-intensive for programmable logic. A promising alternative is to use a purely analytical function, which allows for very fast predictions, but abstracts significantly from reality. Bridging the gap between theory and practice poses a significant challenge to algorithm developers. This paper aims to aid in the development of rapid makespan prediction algorithms by providing a highly flexible evaluation framework for heterogeneous systems consisting of CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs, which is capable of collecting real-world makespan results based on abstract task graph descriptions. We analyze to what extent actual makespans can be predicted by existing analytical approaches. Furthermore, we present common challenges that arise from high-level characteristics such as data transfer overhead and device congestion in heterogeneous systems.

### [From Neural Sensing to Stimulation: An Interdisciplinary Roadmap for Neurotechnology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07116)
**作者**：Ruben Ruiz-Mateos Serrano, Joe G Troughton, Nima Mirkhani, Natalia Martinez, Massimo Mariello, Jordan Tsigarides, Simon Williamson, Juan Sapriza, Ioana Susnoschi Luca, Antonio Dominguez-Alfaro, Estelle Cuttaz, Nicole Thompson, Sydney Swedick, Latifah Almulla, Amparo Guemes

Neurotechnologies are transforming how we measure, interpret, and modulate brain-body interactions, integrating real-time sensing, computation, and stimulation to enable precise physiological control. They hold transformative potential across clinical and non-clinical domains, from treating disorders to enhancing cognition and performance. Realizing this potential requires navigating complex, interdisciplinary challenges spanning neuroscience, materials science, device engineering, signal processing, computational modelling, and regulatory and ethical frameworks. This Perspective presents a strategic roadmap for neurotechnology development, created by early-career researchers, highlighting their role at the intersection of disciplines and their capacity to bridge traditional silos. We identify five cross-cutting trade-offs that constrain progress across functionality, scalability, adaptability, and translatability, and illustrate how technical domains influence their resolution. Rather than a domain-specific review, we focus on shared challenges and strategic opportunities that transcend disciplines. We propose a unified framework for collaborative innovation and education, highlight ethical and regulatory priorities, and outline a timeline for overcoming key bottlenecks. By aligning technical development with translational and societal needs, this roadmap aims to accelerate equitable, effective, and future-ready adaptive neurotechnologies, guiding coordinated efforts across the global research and innovation community.

### [DiLi: A Lock-Free Asynchronously Distributable Linked List](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06387)
**作者**：Raaghav Ravishankar, Sandeep Kulkarni, Sathya Peri, Gokarna Sharma

Modern databases use dynamic search structures that store a huge amount of data, and often serve them using multi-threaded algorithms to support the ever-increasing throughput needs. When this throughput need exceeds the capacity of the machine hosting the structure, one either needs to replace the underlying hardware (an option that is typically not viable and introduces a long down time) or make the data structure distributed. Static partitioning of the data structure for distribution is not desirable, as it is prone to uneven load distribution over time, and having to change the partitioning scheme later will require downtime.  Since a distributed data structure, inherently, relies on communication support from the network stack and operating systems, we introduce the notion of conditional lock-freedom that extends the notion of lock-free computation with reasonable assumptions about communication between processes. We present DiLi, a conditional lock-free, linearizable, and distributable linked list that can be asynchronously and dynamically (1) partitioned into multiple sublists and (2) load balanced by distributing sublists across multiple machines. DiLi contains primitives for these that also maintain the lock-free property of the underlying search structure that supports find, remove, and insert of a key as the client operations.  Searching for an item in DiLi is by a novel traversal that involves a binary search on the partitioning scheme, and then a linear traversal on a limitable number of linked nodes. As a result, we are able to empirically show that DiLi performs as well as the state-of-the-art lock-free concurrent search structures that are based off of a linked list when executed on a single-machine. We also show that the throughput of DiLi scales linearly with the number of machines that host it.

### [MuFASA -- Asynchronous Checkpoint for Weakly Consistent Fully Replicated Databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06404)
**作者**：Raaghav Ravishankar, Sandeep Kulkarni, Nitin H Vaidya

We focus on the problem of checkpointing in fully replicated weakly consistent distributed databases, which we refer to as Distributed Transaction Consistent Snapshot (DTCS). A typical example of such a system is a main-memory database that provides strong eventual consistency. This problem is important and challenging for several reasons: (1) eventual consistency often creates anomalies that the users do not anticipate. Hence, frequent checkpoints to ascertain desired invariants is highly beneficial in their use, and (2) traditional checkpoints lead to significant overhead and/or inconsistencies. By showing that the traditional checkpoint leads to inconsistencies or excessive overhead, we define the notion of size-minimal checkpointing for fully replicated databases. We present an algorithm for checkpointing with minimal checkpointing overhead (only O(n) new messages and addition of a single counter for existing messages). It also provides a significant benefit over existing checkpointing algorithms for distributed systems and main-memory databases.  A key benefit of DTCS is that it summarizes the computation by a sequence of snapshots that are strongly consistent even though the underlying computation is weakly consistent. In essence, when anomalies arise in an eventually consistent system, DTCS enables one to concentrate solely on the snapshots surrounding the time point of the anomaly.

### [REACH: Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Microservice Rescheduling in the Cloud-Edge Continuum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06675)
**作者**：Xu Bai, Muhammed Tawfiqul Islam, Rajkumar Buyya, Adel N. Toosi

Cloud computing, despite its advantages in scalability, may not always fully satisfy the low-latency demands of emerging latency-sensitive pervasive applications. The cloud-edge continuum addresses this by integrating the responsiveness of edge resources with cloud scalability. Microservice Architecture (MSA) characterized by modular, loosely coupled services, aligns effectively with this continuum. However, the heterogeneous and dynamic computing resource poses significant challenges to the optimal placement of microservices. We propose REACH, a novel rescheduling algorithm that dynamically adapts microservice placement in real time using reinforcement learning to react to fluctuating resource availability, and performance variations across distributed infrastructures. Extensive experiments on a real-world testbed demonstrate that REACH reduces average end-to-end latency by 7.9%, 10%, and 8% across three benchmark MSA applications, while effectively mitigating latency fluctuations and spikes.

### [ElasWave: An Elastic-Native System for Scalable Hybrid-Parallel Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00606)
**作者**：Xueze Kang, Guangyu Xiang, Yuxin Wang, Hao Zhang, Yuchu Fang, Yuhang Zhou, Zhenheng Tang, Youhui Lv, Eliran Maman, Mark Wasserman, Alon Zameret, Zhipeng Bian, Shushu Chen, Zhiyou Yu, Jin Wang, Xiaoyu Wu, Yang Zheng, Chen Tian, Xiaowen Chu

Large-scale LLM pretraining now runs across $10^5$--$10^6$ accelerators, making failures routine and elasticity mandatory. We posit that an elastic-native training system must jointly deliver (i) parameter consistency, (ii) low mean time to recovery (MTTR), (iii) high post-change throughput, and (iv) computation consistency. No prior system achieves all four simultaneously. To achieve these goals, we present ElasWave, which delivers per-step fault tolerance via multi-dimensional scheduling across graph, dataflow, DVFS, and RNG. ElasWave reshapes and reshards micro-batches while preserving the global batch size and gradient scale. It performs online pipeline resharding with asynchronous parameter migration and interleaves ZeRO partitions, reducing parameter recovery processes to disjoint rank-to-rank transfers. It further leverages DVFS to absorb pipeline bubbles and reshards RNG to keep computation consistency. Together, a dynamic communicator enables in-place communication group edits, while per-step in-memory snapshots support online verification and redistribution. We evaluate ElasWave on 96 NPUs and benchmark it against state-of-the-art baselines: throughput improves by $1.35\times$ over ReCycle and $1.60\times$ over TorchFT; communicator recovery completes within one second (up to $82\times/3.6\times$ faster than full/partial rebuilds); migration MTTR drops by as much as $51\%$; and convergence deviation is reduced by approximately $78\%$.

### [Layerwise Federated Learning for Heterogeneous Quantum Clients using Quorus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06228)
**作者**：Jason Han, Nicholas S. DiBrita, Daniel Leeds, Jianqiang Li, Jason Ludmir, Tirthak Patel

Quantum machine learning (QML) holds the promise to solve classically intractable problems, but, as critical data can be fragmented across private clients, there is a need for distributed QML in a quantum federated learning (QFL) format. However, the quantum computers that different clients have access to can be error-prone and have heterogeneous error properties, requiring them to run circuits of different depths. We propose a novel solution to this QFL problem, Quorus, that utilizes a layerwise loss function for effective training of varying-depth quantum models, which allows clients to choose models for high-fidelity output based on their individual capacity. Quorus also presents various model designs based on client needs that optimize for shot budget, qubit count, midcircuit measurement, and optimization space. Our simulation and real-hardware results show the promise of Quorus: it increases the magnitude of gradients of higher depth clients and improves testing accuracy by 12.4% on average over the state-of-the-art.

### [Context-Aware Inference via Performance Forecasting in Decentralized Learning Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06444)
**作者**：Joel Pfeffer (Allora Foundation), J. M. Diederik Kruijssen (Allora Foundation), Cl\'ement Gossart (Allora Foundation), M\'elanie Chevance (Allora Foundation), Diego Campo Millan (Allora Foundation), Florian Stecker (Allora Foundation), Steven N. Longmore (Allora Foundation)

In decentralized learning networks, predictions from many participants are combined to generate a network inference. While many studies have demonstrated performance benefits of combining multiple model predictions, existing strategies using linear pooling methods (ranging from simple averaging to dynamic weight updates) face a key limitation. Dynamic prediction combinations that rely on historical performance to update weights are necessarily reactive. Due to the need to average over a reasonable number of epochs (with moving averages or exponential weighting), they tend to be slow to adjust to changing circumstances (phase or regime changes). In this work, we develop a model that uses machine learning to forecast the performance of predictions by models at each epoch in a time series. This enables `context-awareness' by assigning higher weight to models that are likely to be more accurate at a given time. We show that adding a performance forecasting worker in a decentralized learning network, following a design similar to the Allora network, can improve the accuracy of network inferences. Specifically, we find forecasting models that predict regret (performance relative to the network inference) or regret z-score (performance relative to other workers) show greater improvement than models predicting losses, which often do not outperform the naive network inference (historically weighted average of all inferences). Through a series of optimization tests, we show that the performance of the forecasting model can be sensitive to choices in the feature set and number of training epochs. These properties may depend on the exact problem and should be tailored to each domain. Although initially designed for a decentralized learning network, using performance forecasting for prediction combination may be useful in any situation where predictive rather than reactive model weighting is needed.

### [Validation of Various Normalization Methods for Brain Tumor Segmentation: Can Federated Learning Overcome This Heterogeneity?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07126)
**作者**：Jan Fiszer, Dominika Ciupek, Maciej Malawski

Deep learning (DL) has been increasingly applied in medical imaging, however, it requires large amounts of data, which raises many challenges related to data privacy, storage, and transfer. Federated learning (FL) is a training paradigm that overcomes these issues, though its effectiveness may be reduced when dealing with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. This study simulates non-IID conditions by applying different MRI intensity normalization techniques to separate data subsets, reflecting a common cause of heterogeneity. These subsets are then used for training and testing models for brain tumor segmentation. The findings provide insights into the influence of the MRI intensity normalization methods on segmentation models, both training and inference. Notably, the FL methods demonstrated resilience to inconsistently normalized data across clients, achieving the 3D Dice score of 92%, which is comparable to a centralized model (trained using all data). These results indicate that FL is a solution to effectively train high-performing models without violating data privacy, a crucial concern in medical applications. The code is available at: https://github.com/SanoScience/fl-varying-normalization.

### [DPMM-CFL: Clustered Federated Learning via Dirichlet Process Mixture Model Nonparametric Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07132)
**作者**：Mariona Jaramillo-Civill, Peng Wu, Pau Closas

Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) improves performance under non-IID client heterogeneity by clustering clients and training one model per cluster, thereby balancing between a global model and fully personalized models. However, most CFL methods require the number of clusters K to be fixed a priori, which is impractical when the latent structure is unknown. We propose DPMM-CFL, a CFL algorithm that places a Dirichlet Process (DP) prior over the distribution of cluster parameters. This enables nonparametric Bayesian inference to jointly infer both the number of clusters and client assignments, while optimizing per-cluster federated objectives. This results in a method where, at each round, federated updates and cluster inferences are coupled, as presented in this paper. The algorithm is validated on benchmark datasets under Dirichlet and class-split non-IID partitions.

### [KunServe: Parameter-centric Memory Management for Efficient Memory Overloading Handling in LLM Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18169)
**作者**：Rongxin Cheng, Yuxin Lai, Xingda Wei, Rong Chen, Haibo Chen

Serving LLMs with a cluster of GPUs is common nowadays, where the serving system must meet strict latency SLOs required by applications. However, the stateful nature of LLM serving requires maintaining huge states (i.e., KVCache) in limited GPU memory. Under spikes in real-world workloads, GPU memory can be easily throttled, leading to orders of magnitude higher response latency due to queuing introduced by waiting for KVCache to be reclaimed. Prior KVCache-centric approaches handle load throttling by dropping, migrating, or swapping KVCache. These methods fail to release sufficient memory quickly with requests still queued.  This paper proposes the first parameter-centric approach to handling throttling by selectively dropping replicated parameters to instantly free memory for requests, based on an unnoticed observation that model parameters are commonly replicated across GPUs for serving LLMs. With additional memory, all requests can be served with a larger batch without queuing. To make the parameter-centric approach correct and efficient, we cooperatively execute requests on GPUs with a complete copy of parameters using pipeline parallelism, and derive an appropriate drop plan without unnecessary cooperation. We also design techniques to minimize the performance overhead due to pipeline parallelism with the execution patterns of requests under drop. Evaluations show that {\sys} reduces the tail TTFT of requests under throttling by up to 72.2 times compared to the state-of-the-art systems including Llumnix, vLLM and InferCept.

### [Tempo: Compiled Dynamic Deep Learning with Symbolic Dependence Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05408)
**作者**：Pedro F. Silvestre, Peter Pietzuch

Deep learning (DL) algorithms are often defined in terms of temporal relationships: a tensor at one timestep may depend on tensors from earlier or later timesteps. Such dynamic dependencies (and corresponding dynamic tensor shapes) are difficult to express and optimize: while eager DL systems support such dynamism, they cannot apply compiler-based optimizations; graph-based systems require static tensor shapes, which forces users to pad tensors or break-up programs into multiple static graphs.  We describe Tempo, a new DL system that combines the dynamism of eager execution with the whole-program optimizations of graph-based compilation. Tempo achieves this through a declarative programming model with recurrent tensors, which include explicit temporal dimensions. Temporal dimensions can be indexed using symbolic expressions to express dynamic dependencies on past and future tensors. Based on this, Tempo constructs a symbolic dependence graph, which concisely encodes dynamic dependencies between operators, and applies whole-program optimizations, such as algebraic simplifications, vectorization, tiling, and fusion. By tiling dynamic dependencies into static-size blocks, Tempo can also reuse existing static code-generators. It then uses a polyhedral model to find a feasible execution schedule, which includes memory management operations. We show that Tempo achieves a 7$\times$ speedup over JAX for Llama-3.2-3B decoding; for reinforcement learning algorithms, Tempo achieves a 54$\times$ speedup, with 16$\times$ lower peak memory usage.

### [TokenWeave: Efficient Compute-Communication Overlap for Distributed LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11329)
**作者**：Raja Gond, Nipun Kwatra, Ramachandran Ramjee

Distributed inference of large language models (LLMs) can introduce overheads of up to 20% even over GPUs connected via high-speed interconnects such as NVLink. Multiple techniques have been proposed to mitigate these overheads by decomposing computations into finer-grained tasks and overlapping communication with sub-tasks as they complete. However, fine-grained decomposition of a large computation into many smaller computations on GPUs results in overheads. Furthermore, the communication itself uses many streaming multiprocessors (SMs), adding to the overhead.  We present TokenWeave to address these challenges. TokenWeave proposes a Token-Splitting technique that divides the tokens in the inference batch into two approximately equal subsets in a wave-aware manner. The communication of one subset is then overlapped with the computation of the other. In addition, TokenWeave optimizes the order of the layer normalization computation with respect to communication operations and implements a novel fused AllReduce--RMSNorm kernel that carefully leverages Multimem instruction support available on Hopper and Blackwell NVIDIA GPUs. These optimizations allow TokenWeave to perform communication and RMSNorm using only 2-8 SMs. Moreover, our kernel enables the memory-bound RMSNorm to be overlapped with the other batch's computation, providing additional gains.  Our evaluations demonstrate up to 1.29x speedup in latency and 1.26x higher throughput across multiple models and workloads. In several settings, TokenWeave results in better performance compared to an equivalent model with all communication removed.

Speculative decoding is widely adopted to reduce latency in large language model (LLM) inference by leveraging smaller draft models capable of handling diverse user tasks. However, emerging AI applications, such as LLM-based agents, present unique workload characteristics: instead of diverse independent requests, agentic frameworks typically submit repetitive inference requests, such as multi-agent pipelines performing similar subtasks or self-refinement loops iteratively enhancing outputs. These workloads result in long and highly predictable sequences, which current speculative decoding methods do not effectively exploit. To address this gap, we introduce \emph{SuffixDecoding}, a novel method that utilizes efficient suffix trees to cache long token sequences from prompts and previous outputs. By adaptively speculating more tokens when acceptance likelihood is high and fewer when it is low, SuffixDecoding effectively exploits opportunities for longer speculations while conserving computation when those opportunities are limited. Evaluations on agentic benchmarks, including SWE-Bench and Text-to-SQL, demonstrate that SuffixDecoding achieves speedups of up to 5.3$\times$, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- 2.8$\times$ faster than model-based approaches like EAGLE-2/3 and 1.9$\times$ faster than model-free approaches such as Token Recycling.

### [Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Memory Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15492)
**作者**：Arisrei Lim, Abhiram Maddukuri

In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has gained popularity and has been applied to a wide range of tasks. One such popular domain where RL has been effective is resource management problems in systems. We look to extend work on RL for resource management problems by considering the novel domain of dynamic memory allocation management. We consider dynamic memory allocation to be a suitable domain for RL since current algorithms like first-fit, best-fit, and worst-fit can fail to adapt to changing conditions and can lead to fragmentation and suboptimal efficiency. In this paper, we present a framework in which an RL agent continuously learns from interactions with the system to improve memory management tactics. We evaluate our approach through various experiments using high-level and low-level action spaces and examine different memory allocation patterns. Our results show that RL can successfully train agents that can match and surpass traditional allocation strategies, particularly in environments characterized by adversarial request patterns. We also explore the potential of history-aware policies that leverage previous allocation requests to enhance the allocator's ability to handle complex request patterns. Overall, we find that RL offers a promising avenue for developing more adaptive and efficient memory allocation strategies, potentially overcoming limitations of hardcoded allocation algorithms.
