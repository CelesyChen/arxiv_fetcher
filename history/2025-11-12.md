Scientific machine learning research spans diverse domains and data modalities, yet existing benchmark efforts remain siloed and lack standardization. This makes novel and transformative applications of machine learning to critical scientific use-cases more fragmented and less clear in pathways to impact. This paper introduces an ontology for scientific benchmarking developed through a unified, community-driven effort that extends the MLCommons ecosystem to cover physics, chemistry, materials science, biology, climate science, and more. Building on prior initiatives such as XAI-BENCH, FastML Science Benchmarks, PDEBench, and the SciMLBench framework, our effort consolidates a large set of disparate benchmarks and frameworks into a single taxonomy of scientific, application, and system-level benchmarks. New benchmarks can be added through an open submission workflow coordinated by the MLCommons Science Working Group and evaluated against a six-category rating rubric that promotes and identifies high-quality benchmarks, enabling stakeholders to select benchmarks that meet their specific needs. The architecture is extensible, supporting future scientific and AI/ML motifs, and we discuss methods for identifying emerging computing patterns for unique scientific workloads. The MLCommons Science Benchmarks Ontology provides a standardized, scalable foundation for reproducible, cross-domain benchmarking in scientific machine learning. A companion webpage for this work has also been developed as the effort evolves: https://mlcommons-science.github.io/benchmark/

### [Kunlun Anomaly Troubleshooter: Enabling Kernel-Level Anomaly Detection and Causal Reasoning for Large Model Distributed Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05978)
**作者**：Yuyang Liu, Jingjing Cai, Jiayi Ren, Peng Zhou, Danyang Zhang, Yin Du, Shijian Li

Anomaly troubleshooting for large model distributed inference (LMDI) remains a critical challenge. Resolving anomalies such as inference performance degradation or latency jitter in distributed system demands significant manual efforts from domain experts, resulting in extremely time-consuming diagnosis processes with relatively low accuracy. In this paper, we introduce Kunlun Anomaly Troubleshooter (KAT), the first anomaly troubleshooting framework tailored for LMDI. KAT addresses this problem through two core innovations. First, KAT exploits the synchronicity and consistency of GPU workers, innovatively leverages function trace data to precisely detect kernel-level anomalies and associated hardware components at nanosecond resolution. Second, KAT integrates these detection results into a domain-adapted LLM, delivering systematic causal reasoning and natural language interpretation of complex anomaly symptoms. Evaluations conducted in Alibaba Cloud Service production environment indicate that KAT achieves over 0.884 precision and 0.936 recall in anomaly detection, providing detail anomaly insights that significantly narrow down the diagnostic scope and improve both the efficiency and success rate of troubleshooting.

### [Inductive Loop Analysis for Practical HPC Application Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06052)
**作者**：Philipp Schaad, Tal Ben-Nun, Patrick Iff, Torsten Hoefler

Scientific computing applications heavily rely on multi-level loop nests operating on multidimensional arrays. This presents multiple optimization opportunities from exploiting parallelism to reducing data movement through prefetching and improved register usage. HPC frameworks often delegate fine-grained data movement optimization to compilers, but their low-level representations hamper analysis of common patterns, such as strided data accesses and loop-carried dependencies. In this paper, we introduce symbolic, inductive loop optimization (SILO), a novel technique that models data accesses and dependencies as functions of loop nest strides. This abstraction enables the automatic parallelization of sequentially-dependent loops, as well as data movement optimizations including software prefetching and pointer incrementation to reduce register spills. We demonstrate SILO on fundamental kernels from scientific applications with a focus on atmospheric models and numerical solvers, achieving up to 12$\times$ speedup over the state of the art.

### [SWE-fficiency: Can Language Models Optimize Real-World Repositories on Real Workloads?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06090)
**作者**：Jeffrey Jian Ma, Milad Hashemi, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Kevin Swersky, Ofir Press, Enhui Li, Vijay Janapa Reddi, Parthasarathy Ranganathan

Optimizing the performance of large-scale software repositories demands expertise in code reasoning and software engineering (SWE) to reduce runtime while preserving program correctness. However, most benchmarks emphasize what to fix rather than how to fix code. We introduce \textsc{SWE-fficiency}, a benchmark for evaluating repository-level performance optimization on real workloads. Our suite contains 498 tasks across nine widely used data-science, machine-learning, and HPC repositories (e.g., numpy, pandas, scipy): given a complete codebase and a slow workload, an agent must investigate code semantics, localize bottlenecks and relevant tests, and produce a patch that matches or exceeds expert speedup while passing the same unit tests. To enable this how-to-fix evaluation, our automated pipeline scrapes GitHub pull requests for performance-improving edits, combining keyword filtering, static analysis, coverage tooling, and execution validation to both confirm expert speedup baselines and identify relevant repository unit tests. Empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art agents reveals significant underperformance. On average, agents achieve less than 0.15x the expert speedup: agents struggle in localizing optimization opportunities, reasoning about execution across functions, and maintaining correctness in proposed edits. We release the benchmark and accompanying data pipeline to facilitate research on automated performance engineering and long-horizon software reasoning.

### [GPU Cluster Scheduling for Network-Sensitive Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16492)
**作者**：Aakash Sharma, Vivek M. Bhasi, Sonali Singh, George Kesidis, Mahmut T. Kandemir, Chita R. Das

We propose a novel GPU-cluster scheduler for distributed DL (DDL) workloads that enables proximity based consolidation of GPU resources based on the DDL jobs' sensitivities to the anticipated communication-network delays. Our scheduler consists of three major components: (i) a classical delay scheduling algorithm to facilitate job placement and consolidation; (ii) a network-sensitive job preemption strategy; and (iii) an "auto-tuner" mechanism to optimize delay timers for effective delay scheduling. Additionally, to enable a cost-effective methodology for large-scale experiments, we develop a data-driven DDL cluster simulation platform. Employing the simulation platform we compare against several state-of-the-art alternatives on real-world workload traces to demonstrate the benefits of our design. Our scheduler can provide improvement of up to 69% in end-to-end Makespan for training all jobs compared to the prevailing consolidation-based scheduling methods, while reducing the average job completion time by up to 83% and minimizing the communication overheads by up to 98% under congested networking conditions.

### [Hermes: A General-Purpose Proxy-Enabled Networking Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13668)
**作者**：Behrooz Farkiani, Fan Liu, Ke Yang, John DeHart, Jyoti Parwatikar, Patrick Crowley

We introduce Hermes, a general-purpose networking architecture that aims to improve service delivery over the Internet. Hermes delegates networking responsibilities from applications and services to proxies and is designed as a portable, adaptable solution to four fundamental challenges of efficient service delivery over the Internet: end-to-end traffic management, backward compatibility, data-plane security and privacy, and adaptable communication layers. The design centers on an overlay of reconfigurable proxies and HTTP tunneling and proxying techniques, utilizing assisting components to extend proxy functionality when needed. Through prototyping and emulation, we demonstrate that Hermes improves key performance metrics across multiple use cases: it provides backward compatibility through protocol translation and tunneling, improves reliability by delegating retry logic to proxies, enables unified policy-based Layer 3 routing across network segments, and serves as an efficient substrate for future architectures like NDN, facilitating their operation over the Internet. Beyond evaluating Hermes across various use cases, we measured the overhead of Hermes' HTTP tunneling and proxying mechanisms and found it to be modest, typically under 2 ms per hop. With workloads of up to 1000 concurrent requests, we also show that Hermes proxies can amortize connection setup time and reduce end-to-end latency compared to direct no-proxy baselines.

### [Production-Grade Local LLM Inference on Apple Silicon: A Comparative Study of MLX, MLC-LLM, Ollama, llama.cpp, and PyTorch MPS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05502)
**作者**：Varun Rajesh, Om Jodhpurkar, Pooja Anbuselvan, Mantinder Singh, Ashok Jallepali, Shantanu Godbole, Pradeep Kumar Sharma, Hritvik Shrivastava

We present a systematic, empirical evaluation of five local large language model (LLM) runtimes on Apple Silicon: MLX, MLC-LLM, llama.cpp, Ollama, and PyTorch MPS. Experiments were conducted on a Mac Studio equipped with an M2 Ultra processor and 192 GB of unified memory. Using the Qwen-2.5 model family across prompts ranging from a few hundred to 100,000 tokens, we measure time-to-first-token (TTFT), steady-state throughput, latency percentiles, long-context behavior (key-value and prompt caching), quantization support, streaming performance, batching and concurrency behavior, and deployment complexity.  Under our settings, MLX achieves the highest sustained generation throughput, while MLC-LLM delivers consistently lower TTFT for moderate prompt sizes and offers stronger out-of-the-box inference features. llama.cpp is highly efficient for lightweight single-stream use, Ollama emphasizes developer ergonomics but lags in throughput and TTFT, and PyTorch MPS remains limited by memory constraints on large models and long contexts.  All frameworks execute fully on-device with no telemetry, ensuring strong privacy guarantees. We release scripts, logs, and plots to reproduce all results. Our analysis clarifies the design trade-offs in Apple-centric LLM deployments and provides evidence-based recommendations for interactive and long-context processing. Although Apple Silicon inference frameworks still trail NVIDIA GPU-based systems such as vLLM in absolute performance, they are rapidly maturing into viable, production-grade solutions for private, on-device LLM inference.

### [LUT-LLM: Efficient Large Language Model Inference with Memory-based Computations on FPGAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06174)
**作者**：Zifan He, Shengyu Ye, Rui Ma, Yang Wang, Jason Cong

The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has advanced numerous applications, yet efficient single-batch inference remains vital for on-device intelligence. While FPGAs offer fine-grained data control and high energy efficiency, recent GPU optimizations have narrowed their advantage, especially under arithmetic-based computation. To overcome this, we leverage FPGAs' abundant on-chip memory to shift LLM inference from arithmetic- to memory-based computation through table lookups. We present LUT-LLM, the first FPGA accelerator enabling 1B+ LLM inference via vector-quantized memory operations. Our analysis identifies activation-weight co-quantization as the most effective scheme, supported by (1) bandwidth-aware parallel centroid search, (2) efficient 2D table lookups, and (3) a spatial-temporal hybrid design minimizing data caching. Implemented on an AMD V80 FPGA for a customized Qwen 3 1.7B model, LUT-LLM achieves 1.66x lower latency than AMD MI210 and 1.72x higher energy efficiency than NVIDIA A100, scaling to 32B models with 2.16x efficiency gain over A100.

### [iEEG Seizure Detection with a Sparse Hyperdimensional Computing Accelerator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05503)
**作者**：Stef Cuyckens, Ryan Antonio, Chao Fang, Marian Verhelst

Implantable devices for reliable intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) require efficient, accurate, and real-time detection of seizures. Dense hyperdimensional computing (HDC) proves to be efficient over neural networks; however, it still consumes considerable switching power for an ultra-low energy application. Sparse HDC, on the other hand, has the potential of further reducing the energy consumption, yet at the expense of having to support more complex operations and introducing an extra hyperparameter, the maximum hypervector density. To improve the energy and area efficiency of the sparse HDC operations, this work introduces the compressed item memory (CompIM) and simplifies the spatial bundling. We also analyze how a proper hyperparameter choice improves the detection delay compared to dense HDC. Ultimately, our optimizations achieve a 1.73x more energy- and 2.20x more area-efficient hardware design than the naive sparse implementation. We are also 7.50x more energy- and 3.24x more area-efficient than the dense HDC implementation. This work highlights the hardware advantages of sparse HDC, demonstrating its potential to enable smaller brain implants with a substantially extended battery life compared to the current state-of-the-art.

### [P3-LLM: An Integrated NPU-PIM Accelerator for LLM Inference Using Hybrid Numerical Formats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06838)
**作者**：Yuzong Chen, Chao Fang, Xilai Dai, Yuheng Wu, Thierry Tambe, Marian Verhelst, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah

The substantial memory bandwidth and computational demand of large language models (LLMs) present critical challenges for efficient inference. To tackle this, the literature has explored heterogeneous systems that combine neural processing units (NPUs) with DRAM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) for LLM acceleration. However, existing high-precision (e.g., FP16) PIM compute units incur significant area and power overhead in DRAM technology, limiting the effective computation throughput. In this paper, we introduce P3-LLM, a novel NPU-PIM integrated accelerator for LLM inference using hybrid numerical formats. Our approach is threefold: First, we propose a flexible mixed-precision quantization scheme, which leverages hybrid numerical formats to quantize different LLM operands with high compression efficiency and minimal accuracy loss. Second, we architect an efficient PIM accelerator co-design for P3-LLM, featuring lightweight compute units to support our hybrid numerical formats. The enhanced PIM compute units significantly boost the computation throughput under iso-area constraints. Third, we optimize the low-precision dataflow of different LLM modules by applying operator fusion to minimize the overhead of runtime dequantization. Our evaluation on a diverse set of representative LLMs and tasks demonstrates that P3-LLM achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy in terms of both KV-cache-only quantization and weight-activation quantization. Combining the proposed quantization scheme with PIM architecture co-design, P3-LLM yields an average of $4.9\times$, $2.0\times$, and $3.4\times$ speedups over the state-of-the-art LLM accelerators HBM-PIM, Ecco, and Pimba, respectively. Our quantization code is available at https://github.com/yc2367/P3-LLM.git

### [YAP+: Pad-Layout-Aware Yield Modeling and Simulation for Hybrid Bonding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05506)
**作者**：Zhichao Chen, Puneet Gupta

Three-dimensional (3D) integration continues to advance Moore's Law by facilitating dense interconnects and enabling multi-tier system architectures. Among the various integration approaches, Cu-Cu hybrid bonding has emerged as a leading solution for achieving high interconnect density in chiplet integration. In this work, we present YAP+, a yield modeling framework specifically tailored for wafer-to-wafer (W2W) and die-to-wafer (D2W) hybrid bonding processes. YAP+ incorporates a comprehensive set of yield-impacting failure mechanisms, including overlay misalignment, particle defects, Cu recess variations, surface roughness, and Cu pad density. Furthermore, YAP+ supports pad layout-aware yield analysis, considering critical, redundant, and dummy pads across arbitrary 2D physical layout patterns. To support practical evaluation, we developed an open-source yield simulator, demonstrating that our near-analytical model matches simulation accuracy while achieving over 1,000x speedup in runtime. This performance makes YAP+ a valuable tool for co-optimizing packaging technologies, assembly design rules, and system-level design strategies. Beyond W2W-D2W comparisons, we leverage YAP+ to investigate the impact of pad layout patterns, bonding pitch, and pad ratios across different pad types, and explore the benefits of strategically placing redundant pad replicas.

### [Delay Time Characterization on FPGA: A Low Nonlinearity, Picosecond Resolution Time-to-Digital Converter on 16-nm FPGA using Bin Sequence Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05583)
**作者**：Sunwoo Park, Byungkwon Park, Eunsung Kim, Jiwon Yune, Seungho Han, Seunggo Nam

We present a Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) implemented on a 16 nm Xilinx UltraScale Plus FPGA that achieves a resolution of 1.15 ps, RMS precision of 3.38 ps, a differential nonlinearity (DNL) of [-0.43, 0.24] LSB, and an integral nonlinearity (INL) of [-2.67, 0.15] LSB. This work introduces two novel hardware-independent post-processing techniques - Partial Order Reconstruction (POR) and Iterative Time-bin Interleaving (ITI) - that significantly enhance the performance of FPGA-based TDCs. POR addresses the missing code problem by inferring the partial order of each time bin through code density test data and directed acyclic graph (DAG) analysis, enabling near-complete recovery of usable bins. ITI further improves fine time resolution by merging multiple calibrated tapped delay lines (TDLs) into a single unified delay chain, achieving scalable resolution without resorting to averaging. Compared to state-of-the-art FPGA-based TDC architectures, the proposed methods deliver competitive or superior performance with reduced hardware overhead. These techniques are broadly applicable to high-resolution time measurement and precise delay calibration in programmable logic platforms.

### [STAR: Improving Lifetime and Performance of High-Capacity Modern SSDs Using State-Aware Randomizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06249)
**作者**：Omin Kwon, Kyungjun Oh, Jaeyong Lee, Myungsuk Kim, Jihong Kim

Although NAND flash memory has achieved continuous capacity improvements via advanced 3D stacking and multi-level cell technologies, these innovations introduce new reliability challenges, par- ticularly lateral charge spreading (LCS), absent in low-capacity 2D flash memory. Since LCS significantly increases retention errors over time, addressing this problem is essential to ensure the lifetime of modern SSDs employing high-capacity 3D flash memory. In this paper, we propose a novel data randomizer, STate-Aware Randomizer (STAR), which proactively eliminates the majority of weak data patterns responsible for retention errors caused by LCS. Unlike existing techniques that target only specific worst-case patterns, STAR effectively removes a broad spectrum of weak patterns, significantly enhancing reliability against LCS. By employing several optimization schemes, STAR can be efficiently integrated into the existing I/O datapath of an SSD controller with negligible timing overhead. To evaluate the proposed STAR scheme, we developed a STAR-aware SSD emulator based on characterization results from 160 real 3D NAND flash chips. Experimental results demonstrate that STAR improves SSD lifetime by up to 2.3x and reduces read latency by an average of 50% on real-world traces compared to conventional SSDs

### [EONSim: An NPU Simulator for On-Chip Memory and Embedding Vector Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06679)
**作者**：Sangun Choi, Yunho Oh

Embedding vector operations are a key component of modern deep neural network workloads. Unlike matrix operations with deterministic access patterns, embedding vector operations exhibit input data-dependent and non-deterministic memory accesses. Existing neural processing unit (NPU) simulators focus on matrix computations with simple double-buffered on-chip memory systems, lacking the modeling capability for realistic embedding behavior. Next-generation NPUs, however, call for more flexible on-chip memory architectures that can support diverse access and management schemes required by embedding workloads. To enable flexible exploration and design of emerging NPU architectures, we present EONSim, an NPU simulator that holistically models both matrix and embedding vector operations. EONSim integrates a validated performance model for matrix computations with detailed memory simulation for embedding accesses, supporting various on-chip memory management policies. Validated against TPUv6e, EONSim achieves an average inference time error of 1.4\% and an average on-chip memory access count error of 2.2\%.

### [Optimizing GEMM for Energy and Performance on Versal ACAP Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06907)
**作者**：Ilias Papalamprou, Dimosthenis Masouros, Ioannis Loudaros, Francky Catthoor, Dimitrios Soudris

General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) is a fundamental operation in many scientific workloads, signal processing, and particularly deep learning. It is often a bottleneck for performance and energy efficiency, especially in edge environments with tight resource and power constraints. AMD's Versal ACAP offers heterogeneous components (AIEs, PL, PS) that can address these challenges, but mapping GEMM across them is complex, with prior works largely overlooking energy-performance trade-offs. In this paper, we propose an automated framework for Versal ACAP that generates GEMM mappings optimized for either performance or energy efficiency. Unlike prior analytical approaches, our method leverages a Machine Learning (ML) model, trained on approximately 6000 on-board experiments of different GEMM mappings, to guide Design Space Exploration, yielding more efficient designs. Evaluation on the Versal VCK190 shows geomean improvements of 1.23x (up to 2.5x) in throughput and 1.25x (up to 2.7x) in energy efficiency over state-of-the-art frameworks.

### [FPGA-Accelerated RISC-V ISA Extensions for Efficient Neural Network Inference on Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06955)
**作者**：Arya Parameshwara, Santosh Hanamappa Mokashi

Edge AI deployment faces critical challenges balancing computational performance, energy efficiency, and resource constraints. This paper presents FPGA-accelerated RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) extensions for efficient neural network inference on resource-constrained edge devices. We introduce a custom RISC-V core with four novel ISA extensions (FPGA.VCONV, FPGA.GEMM, FPGA.RELU, FPGA.CUSTOM) and integrated neural network accelerators, implemented and validated on the Xilinx PYNQ-Z2 platform. The complete system achieves 2.14x average latency speedup and 49.1% energy reduction versus an ARM Cortex-A9 software baseline across four benchmark models (MobileNet V2, ResNet-18, EfficientNet Lite, YOLO Tiny). Hardware implementation closes timing with +12.793 ns worst negative slack at 50 MHz while using 0.43% LUTs and 11.4% BRAM for the base core and 38.8% DSPs when accelerators are active. Hardware verification confirms successful FPGA deployment with verified 64 KB BRAM memory interface and AXI interconnect functionality. All performance metrics are obtained from physical hardware measurements. This work establishes a reproducible framework for ISA-guided FPGA acceleration that complements fixed-function ASICs by trading peak performance for programmability.

### [Precision-Scalable Microscaling Datapaths with Optimized Reduction Tree for Efficient NPU Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06313)
**作者**：Stef Cuyckens, Xiaoling Yi, Robin Geens, Joren Dumoulin, Martin Wiesner, Chao Fang, Marian Verhelst

Emerging continual learning applications necessitate next-generation neural processing unit (NPU) platforms to support both training and inference operations. The promising Microscaling (MX) standard enables narrow bit-widths for inference and large dynamic ranges for training. However, existing MX multiply-accumulate (MAC) designs face a critical trade-off: integer accumulation requires expensive conversions from narrow floating-point products, while FP32 accumulation suffers from quantization losses and costly normalization. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid precision-scalable reduction tree for MX MACs that combines the benefits of both approaches, enabling efficient mixed-precision accumulation with controlled accuracy relaxation. Moreover, we integrate an 8x8 array of these MACs into the state-of-the-art (SotA) NPU integration platform, SNAX, to provide efficient control and data transfer to our optimized precision-scalable MX datapath. We evaluate our design both on MAC and system level and compare it to the SotA. Our integrated system achieves an energy efficiency of 657, 1438-1675, and 4065 GOPS/W, respectively, for MXINT8, MXFP8/6, and MXFP4, with a throughput of 64, 256, and 512 GOPS.

### [Offloading Data Center Tax](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06558)
**作者**：Akshay Revankar, Charan Renganathan, Sartaj Wariah

The data centers of today are running diverse workloads sharing many common lower level functions called tax components. Any optimization to any tax component will lead to performance improvements across the data center fleet. Typically, performance enhancements in tax components are achieved by offloading them to accelerators, however, it is not practical to offload every tax component. The goal of this paper is to identify opportunities to offload more than one tax component together. We focus on MongoDB which is a common microservice used in a large number of applications in the datacenter. We profile MongoDB running as part of the DeathStarBench benchmark suite, identifying its tax components and their microarchitectural implications. We make observations and suggestions based on the inferences made to offload a few of the tax components in this application.

### [FPGA or GPU? Analyzing comparative research for application-specific guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06565)
**作者**：Arnab A Purkayastha, Jay Tharwani, Shobhit Aggarwal

The growing complexity of computational workloads has amplified the need for efficient and specialized hardware accelerators. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have emerged as prominent solutions, each excelling in specific domains. Although there is substantial research comparing FPGAs and GPUs, most of the work focuses primarily on performance metrics, offering limited insight into the specific types of applications that each accelerator benefits the most. This paper aims to bridge this gap by synthesizing insights from various research articles to guide users in selecting the appropriate accelerator for domain-specific applications. By categorizing the reviewed studies and analyzing key performance metrics, this work highlights the strengths, limitations, and ideal use cases for FPGAs and GPUs. The findings offer actionable recommendations, helping researchers and practitioners navigate trade-offs in performance, energy efficiency, and programmability.

### [Preemption-Enhanced Benchmark Suite for FPGAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06736)
**作者**：Arsalan Ali Malik, John Buchanan, Aydin Aysu

Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have become essential in cloud computing due to their reconfigurability, energy efficiency, and ability to accelerate domain-specific workloads. As FPGA adoption grows, research into task scheduling and preemption techniques has intensified. However, the field lacks a standardized benchmarking framework for consistent and reproducible evaluation. Many existing studies propose innovative scheduling or preemption mechanisms but often rely on proprietary or synthetic benchmarks, limiting generalizability and making comparison difficult. This methodical fragmentation hinders effective evaluation of scheduling strategies and preemption in multi-tenant FPGA environments.  This paper presents the first open-source preemption-enabled benchmark suite for evaluating FPGA preemption strategies and testing new scheduling algorithms, without requiring users to create preemption workloads from scratch. The suite includes 27 diverse applications spanning cryptography, AI/ML, computation-intensive workloads, communication systems, and multimedia processing. Each benchmark integrates comprehensive context-saving and restoration mechanisms, facilitating reproducible research and consistent comparisons. Our suite not only simplifies testing FPGA scheduling policies but also benefits OS research by enabling the evaluation of scheduling fairness, resource allocation efficiency, and context-switching performance in multi-tenant FPGA systems, ultimately supporting the development of better operating systems and scheduling policies for FPGA-based environments. We also provide guidelines for adding new benchmarks, enabling future research to expand and refine FPGA preemption and scheduling evaluation.

### [ASTER: Attention-based Spiking Transformer Engine for Event-driven Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06770)
**作者**：Tamoghno Das, Khanh Phan Vu, Hanning Chen, Hyunwoo Oh, Mohsen Imani

The integration of spiking neural networks (SNNs) with transformer-based architectures has opened new opportunities for bio-inspired low-power, event-driven visual reasoning on edge devices. However, the high temporal resolution and binary nature of spike-driven computation introduce architectural mismatches with conventional digital hardware (CPU/GPU). Prior neuromorphic and Processing-in-Memory (PIM) accelerators struggle with high sparsity and complex operations prevalent in such models. To address these challenges, we propose a memory-centric hardware accelerator tailored for spiking transformers, optimized for deployment in real-time event-driven frameworks such as classification with both static and event-based input frames. Our design leverages a hybrid analog-digital PIM architecture with input sparsity optimizations, and a custom-designed dataflow to minimize memory access overhead and maximize data reuse under spatiotemporal sparsity, for compute and memory-efficient end-to-end execution of spiking transformers. We subsequently propose inference-time software optimizations for layer skipping, and timestep reduction, leveraging Bayesian Optimization with surrogate modeling to perform robust, efficient co-exploration of the joint algorithmic-microarchitectural design spaces under tight computational budgets. Evaluated on both image(ImageNet) and event-based (CIFAR-10 DVS, DVSGesture) classification, the accelerator achieves up to ~467x and ~1.86x energy reduction compared to edge GPU (Jetson Orin Nano) and previous PIM accelerators for spiking transformers, while maintaining competitive task accuracy on ImageNet dataset. This work enables a new class of intelligent ubiquitous edge AI, built using spiking transformer acceleration for low-power, real-time visual processing at the extreme edge.

### [FiCABU: A Fisher-Based, Context-Adaptive Machine Unlearning Processor for Edge AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05605)
**作者**：Eun-Su Cho, Jongin Choi, Jeongmin Jin, Jae-Jin Lee, Woojoo Lee

Machine unlearning, driven by privacy regulations and the "right to be forgotten", is increasingly needed at the edge, yet server-centric or retraining-heavy methods are impractical under tight computation and energy budgets. We present FiCABU (Fisher-based Context-Adaptive Balanced Unlearning), a software-hardware co-design that brings unlearning to edge AI processors. FiCABU combines (i) Context-Adaptive Unlearning, which begins edits from back-end layers and halts once the target forgetting is reached, with (ii) Balanced Dampening, which scales dampening strength by depth to preserve retain accuracy. These methods are realized in a full RTL design of a RISC-V edge AI processor that integrates two lightweight IPs for Fisher estimation and dampening into a GEMM-centric streaming pipeline, validated on an FPGA prototype and synthesized in 45 nm for power analysis. Across CIFAR-20 and PinsFaceRecognition with ResNet-18 and ViT, FiCABU achieves random-guess forget accuracy while matching the retraining-free Selective Synaptic Dampening (SSD) baseline on retain accuracy, reducing computation by up to 87.52 percent (ResNet-18) and 71.03 percent (ViT). On the INT8 hardware prototype, FiCABU further improves retain preservation and reduces energy to 6.48 percent (CIFAR-20) and 0.13 percent (PinsFaceRecognition) of the SSD baseline. In sum, FiCABU demonstrates that back-end-first, depth-aware unlearning can be made both practical and efficient for resource-constrained edge AI devices.

### [AiEDA: An Open-Source AI-Aided Design Library for Design-to-Vector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05823)
**作者**：Yihang Qiu, Zengrong Huang, Simin Tao, Hongda Zhang, Weiguo Li, Xinhua Lai, Rui Wang, Weiqiang Wang, Xingquan Li

Recent research has demonstrated that artificial intelligence (AI) can assist electronic design automation (EDA) in improving both the quality and efficiency of chip design. But current AI for EDA (AI-EDA) infrastructures remain fragmented, lacking comprehensive solutions for the entire data pipeline from design execution to AI integration. Key challenges include fragmented flow engines that generate raw data, heterogeneous file formats for data exchange, non-standardized data extraction methods, and poorly organized data storage. This work introduces a unified open-source library for EDA (AiEDA) that addresses these issues. AiEDA integrates multiple design-to-vector data representation techniques that transform diverse chip design data into universal multi-level vector representations, establishing an AI-aided design (AAD) paradigm optimized for AI-EDA workflows. AiEDA provides complete physical design flows with programmatic data extraction and standardized Python interfaces bridging EDA datasets and AI frameworks. Leveraging the AiEDA library, we generate iDATA, a 600GB dataset of structured data derived from 50 real chip designs (28nm), and validate its effectiveness through seven representative AAD tasks spanning prediction, generation, optimization and analysis. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/OSCC-Project/AiEDA, while the full iDATA dataset is being prepared for public release, providing a foundation for future AI-EDA research.

**作者**：Theofanis Vergos, Polykarpos Vergos, Mehdi B. Tahoori, Georgios Zervakis

Flexible electronics offer unique advantages for conformable, lightweight, and disposable healthcare wearables. However, their limited gate count, large feature sizes, and high static power consumption make on-body machine learning classification highly challenging. While existing bendable RISC-V systems provide compact solutions, they lack the energy efficiency required. We present a mechanically flexible RISC-V that integrates a bespoke multiply-accumulate co-processor with fixed coefficients to maximize energy efficiency and minimize latency. Our approach formulates a constrained programming problem to jointly determine co-processor constants and optimally map Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) inference operations, enabling compact, model-specific hardware by leveraging the low fabrication and non-recurring engineering costs of flexible technologies. Post-layout results demonstrate near-real-time performance across several healthcare datasets, with our circuits operating within the power budget of existing flexible batteries and occupying only 2.42 mm^2, offering a promising path toward accessible, sustainable, and conformable healthcare wearables. Our microprocessors achieve an average 2.35x speedup and 2.15x lower energy consumption compared to the state of the art.

As machine learning (ML) is increasingly implemented in hardware to address real-time challenges in scientific applications, the development of advanced toolchains has significantly reduced the time required to iterate on various designs. These advancements have solved major obstacles, but also exposed new challenges. For example, processes that were not previously considered bottlenecks, such as hardware synthesis, are becoming limiting factors in the rapid iteration of designs. To mitigate these emerging constraints, multiple efforts have been undertaken to develop an ML-based surrogate model that estimates resource usage of ML accelerator architectures. We introduce wa-hls4ml, a benchmark for ML accelerator resource and latency estimation, and its corresponding initial dataset of over 680,000 fully connected and convolutional neural networks, all synthesized using hls4ml and targeting Xilinx FPGAs. The benchmark evaluates the performance of resource and latency predictors against several common ML model architectures, primarily originating from scientific domains, as exemplar models, and the average performance across a subset of the dataset. Additionally, we introduce GNN- and transformer-based surrogate models that predict latency and resources for ML accelerators. We present the architecture and performance of the models and find that the models generally predict latency and resources for the 75% percentile within several percent of the synthesized resources on the synthetic test dataset.

### [Lite VLA: Efficient Vision-Language-Action Control on CPU-Bound Edge Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05642)
**作者**：Justin Williams, Kishor Datta Gupta, Roy George, Mrinmoy Sarkar

The deployment of artificial intelligence models at the edge is increasingly critical for autonomous robots operating in GPS-denied environments where local, resource-efficient reasoning is essential. This work demonstrates the feasibility of deploying small Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on mobile robots to achieve real-time scene understanding and reasoning under strict computational constraints. Unlike prior approaches that separate perception from mobility, the proposed framework enables simultaneous movement and reasoning in dynamic environments using only on-board hardware. The system integrates a compact VLM with multimodal perception to perform contextual interpretation directly on embedded hardware, eliminating reliance on cloud connectivity. Experimental validation highlights the balance between computational efficiency, task accuracy, and system responsiveness. Implementation on a mobile robot confirms one of the first successful deployments of small VLMs for concurrent reasoning and mobility at the edge. This work establishes a foundation for scalable, assured autonomy in applications such as service robotics, disaster response, and defense operations.

### [Distributed Recoverable Sketches (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05762)
**作者**：Diana Cohen, Roy Friedman, Rana Shahout

Sketches are commonly used in computer systems and network monitoring tools to provide efficient query executions while maintaining a compact data representation. Switches and routers maintain sketches to track statistical characteristics of network traffic. The availability of such data is essential for the network analysis as a whole. Consequently, being able to recover sketches is critical after a switch crash. In this work, we explore how nodes in a network environment can cooperate to recover sketch data whenever any subset of them crashes. In particular, we focus on frequency estimation linear sketches, such as the Count-Min Sketch. We consider various approaches to ensure data reliability and explore the trade-offs between space consumption, runtime overheads, and traffic during recovery, which we point out as design guidelines. Besides different aspects of efficacy, we design a modular system for ease of maintenance and further scaling. A key aspect we examine is how the nodes update each other regarding their sketch content as it evolves over time. In particular, we compare periodic full updates vs incremental updates. We also examine several data structures to economically represent and encode a batch of latest changes. Our framework is generic, and other data structures can be plugged-in via an abstract API as long as they implement the corresponding API methods.

### [HYDRA: Breaking the Global Ordering Barrier in Multi-BFT Consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05843)
**作者**：Hanzheng Lyu, Shaokang Xie, Jianyu Niu, Mohammad Sadoghi, Yinqian Zhang, Cong Wang, Ivan Beschastnikh, Chen Feng

Multi-Byzantine Fault Tolerant (Multi-BFT) consensus, which runs multiple BFT instances in parallel, has recently emerged as a promising approach to overcome the leader bottleneck in classical BFT protocols. However, existing designs rely on a global ordering layer to serialize blocks across instances, an intuitive yet costly mechanism that constrains scalability, amplifies failure propagation, and complicates deployment. In this paper, we challenge this conventional wisdom. We present HYDRA, the first Multi-BFT consensus framework that eliminates global ordering altogether. HYDRA introduces an object-centric execution model that partitions transactions by their accessed objects, enabling concurrent yet deterministic execution across instances. To ensure consistency, HYDRA combines lightweight lock-based coordination with a deadlock resolution mechanism, achieving both scalability and correctness. We implement HYDRA and evaluate it on up to 128 replicas in both LAN and WAN environments. Experimental results show HYDRA outperforms several state-of-the-art Multi-BFT protocols in the presence of a straggler. These results demonstrate strong consistency and high performance by removing global ordering, opening a new direction toward scalable Multi-BFT consensus design.

### [CoEdge-RAG: Optimizing Hierarchical Scheduling for Retrieval-Augmented LLMs in Collaborative Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05915)
**作者**：Guihang Hong, Tao Ouyang, Kongyange Zhao, Zhi Zhou, Xu Chen

Motivated by the imperative for real-time responsiveness and data privacy preservation, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on resource-constrained edge devices to enable localized inference. To improve output quality, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an efficient technique that seamlessly integrates local data into LLMs. However, existing edge computing paradigms primarily focus on single-node optimization, neglecting opportunities to holistically exploit distributed data and heterogeneous resources through cross-node collaboration. To bridge this gap, we propose CoEdge-RAG, a hierarchical scheduling framework for retrieval-augmented LLMs in collaborative edge computing. In general, privacy constraints preclude accurate a priori acquisition of heterogeneous data distributions across edge nodes, directly impeding RAG performance optimization. Thus, we first design an online query identification mechanism using proximal policy optimization (PPO), which autonomously infers query semantics and establishes cross-domain knowledge associations in an online manner. Second, we devise a dynamic inter-node scheduling strategy that balances workloads across heterogeneous edge nodes by synergizing historical performance analytics with real-time resource thresholds. Third, we develop an intra-node scheduler based on online convex optimization, adaptively allocating query processing ratios and memory resources to optimize the latency-quality trade-off under fluctuating assigned loads. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse QA benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method significantly boosts the performance of collaborative retrieval-augmented LLMs, achieving performance gains of 4.23\% to 91.39\% over baseline methods across all tasks.

### [MT4G: A Tool for Reliable Auto-Discovery of NVIDIA and AMD GPU Compute and Memory Topologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05958)
**作者**：Stepan Vanecek, Manuel Walter Mussbacher, Dominik Groessler, Urvij Saroliya, Martin Schulz

Understanding GPU topology is essential for performance-related tasks in HPC or AI. Yet, unlike for CPUs with tools like hwloc, GPU information is hard to come by, incomplete, and vendor-specific.  In this work, we address this gap and present MT4G, an open-source and vendor-agnostic tool that automatically discovers GPU compute and memory topologies and configurations, including cache sizes, bandwidths, and physical layouts. MT4G combines existing APIs with a suite of over 50 microbenchmarks, applying statistical methods, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, to automatically and reliably identify otherwise programmatically unavailable topological attributes.  We showcase MT4G's universality on ten different GPUs and demonstrate its impact through integration into three workflows: GPU performance modeling, GPUscout bottleneck analysis, and dynamic resource partitioning. These scenarios highlight MT4G's role in understanding system performance and characteristics across NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, providing an automated, portable solution for modern HPC and AI systems.

### [DWM-RO: Decentralized World Models with Reasoning Offloading for SWIPT-enabled Satellite-Terrestrial HetNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05972)
**作者**：Guangyuan Liu, Yinqiu Liu, Ruichen Zhang, Dusit Niyato, Jiawen Kang, Sumei Sun, Abbas Jamalipour, Ping Zhang

Wireless networks are undergoing a paradigm shift toward massive connectivity with energy-efficient operation, driving the integration of satellite-terrestrial architectures with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). Optimizing transmit beamforming and power splitting in such systems faces formidable challenges, e.g., time-varying channels and multi-tier interference, which create a complex decision landscape where conventional model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) suffers from sample inefficiency due to rarely-encountered state transitions and poor coordination as decentralized agents act independently. This paper proposes the Decentralized World Model with Reasoning Offloading (DWM-RO) framework to address these fundamental limitations. Specifically, each agent employs a world model to learn compact predictive representations of environment dynamics, enabling imagination-based policy training that dramatically reduces required environment interactions. An uncertainty-aware offloading gate monitors local interference levels and model reconstruction errors to trigger selective edge coordination. When activated, a lightweight latent decorrelation mechanism at the edge refines agents' strategic representations, guiding them toward orthogonal actions that minimize resource conflicts. Extensive simulations demonstrate that DWM-RO converges 5 times faster than state-of-the-art baselines while achieving 34.7% higher spectral efficiency and reducing constraint violations by 40%. In dense network scenarios with 10 users, DWM-RO maintains violation rates below 20% while baselines exceed 70%, validating superior robustness.

### [Elastic Data Transfer Optimization with Hybrid Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06159)
**作者**：Rasman Mubtasim Swargo, Md Arifuzzaman

Modern scientific data acquisition generates petabytes of data that must be transferred to geographically distant computing clusters. Conventional tools either rely on preconfigured sessions, which are difficult to tune for users without domain expertise, or they adaptively optimize only concurrency while ignoring other important parameters. We present \name, an adaptive data transfer method that jointly considers multiple parameters. Our solution incorporates heuristic-based parallelism, infinite pipelining, and a deep reinforcement learning based concurrency optimizer. To make agent training practical, we introduce a lightweight network simulator that reduces training time to less than four minutes and provides a $2750\times$ speedup compared to online training. Experimental evaluation shows that \name consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse datasets, achieving up to 9.5x higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art solutions.

### [LiteCast: A Lightweight Forecaster for Carbon Optimizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06187)
**作者**：Mathew Joseph, Tanush Savadi, Abel Souza

Over recent decades, electricity demand has experienced sustained growth through widespread electrification of transportation and the accelerated expansion of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Grids have managed the resulting surges by scaling generation capacity, incorporating additional resources such as solar and wind, and implementing demand-response mechanisms. Altogether, these policies influence a region's carbon intensity by affecting its energy mix. To mitigate the environmental impacts of consumption, carbon-aware optimizations often rely on long-horizon, high-accuracy forecasts of the grid's carbon intensity that typically use compute intensive models with extensive historical energy mix data. In addition to limiting scalability, accuracy improvements do not necessarily translate into proportional increases in savings. Highlighting the need for more efficient forecasting strategies, we argue that carbon forecasting solutions can achieve the majority of savings without requiring highly precise and complex predictions. Instead, it is the preservation of the ranking of forecasts relative to the ground-truth that drives realized savings. In this paper, we present LiteCast, a lightweight time series forecasting method capable of quickly modeling a region's energy mix to estimate its carbon intensity. LiteCast requires only a few days of historical energy and weather data, delivering fast forecasts that can quickly adapt to sudden changes in the electrical grid. Our evaluation in 50 worldwide regions under various real-world workloads shows that LiteCast outperforms state-of-the-art forecasters, delivering 20% higher savings with near-optimal performance, achieving 97% of the maximum attainable average savings, while remaining lightweight, efficient to run, and adaptive to new data.

### [Optimizing Long-context LLM Serving via Fine-grained Sequence Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06247)
**作者**：Cong Li, Yuzhe Yang, Xuegui Zheng, Qifan Yang, Yijin Guan, Size Zheng, Li-Wen Chang, Shufan Liu, Xin Liu, Guangyu Sun

With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), their context windows have rapidly expanded. To meet diverse demands from varying-length requests in online services, existing state-of-the-art systems tune the sequence parallelism (SP) allocation. However, current dynamic SP allocation lacks flexibility to (1) support stage-specific parallelism requirements in LLM inference, (2) mitigate the global latency degradation from excessive SP allocation, and (3) exploit resource fragments arising from SP size variation.  To tackle this problem, we propose Chunkwise Dynamic Sequence Parallelism (CDSP), a fine-grained parallelism strategy that assigns SP sizes across \textit{intra-request} token segments. Based on CDSP, we build Tetris, an LLM serving system that (1) efficiently integrates CDSP into disaggregated cluster to satisfy parallelism heterogeneity, (2) dynamically regulates SP size expansion based on real-time load conditions, and (3) adaptively explores chunking plans to utilize fragmented resources while meeting per-request demands. Compared with state-of-the-art systems, Tetris achieves up to 4.35$\times$ lower time-to-first-token (TTFT) under max sustainable loads, reduces median time-between-tokens (TBT) by up to 40.1\%, and increases the max request capacity by up to 45\%.

### [Saarthi: An End-to-End Intelligent Platform for Optimising Distributed Serverless Workloads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06599)
**作者**：Siddharth Agarwal, Maria A. Rodriguez, Rajkumar Buyya

FaaS offers significant advantages with its infrastructure abstraction, on-demand execution, and attractive no idle resource pricing for modern cloud applications. Despite these benefits, challenges such as startup latencies, static configurations, sub-optimal resource allocation and scheduling still exist due to coupled resource offering and workload-agnostic generic scheduling behaviour. These issues often lead to inconsistent function performance and unexpected operational costs for users and service providers. This paper introduces Saarthi, a novel, end-to-end serverless framework that intelligently manages the dynamic resource needs of function workloads, representing a significant step toward self-driving serverless platforms. Unlike platforms that rely on static resource configurations, Saarthi is input-aware, allowing it to intelligently anticipate resource requirements based on the characteristics of an incoming request payload. This input-driven approach reinforces function right-sizing and enables smart request orchestration across available function configurations. Saarthi further integrates a proactive fault-tolerant redundancy mechanism and employs a multi-objective Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to maintain an optimal function quantity. This optimisation aims to maximise system throughput while simultaneously reducing overall operational costs. We validate the effectiveness of Saarthi by implementing it as a framework atop OpenFaaS. Our results demonstrate Saarthi's ability to achieve up to 1.45x better throughput, 1.84x reduced costs, while maintaining up to 98.3% service level targets with an overhead of up to 0.2 seconds as compared to the baseline OpenFaaS.

### [PRAGMA: A Profiling-Reasoned Multi-Agent Framework for Automatic Kernel Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06345)
**作者**：Kelun Lei, Hailong Yang, Huaitao Zhang, Xin You, Kaige Zhang, Zhongzhi Luan, Yi Liu, Depei Qian

Designing high-performance kernels requires expert-level tuning and a deep understanding of hardware characteristics. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled automated kernel generation, yet most existing systems rely solely on correctness or execution time feedback, lacking the ability to reason about low-level performance bottlenecks. In this paper, we introduce PRAGMA, a profile-guided AI kernel generation framework that integrates execution feedback and fine-grained hardware profiling into the reasoning loop. PRAGMA enables LLMs to identify performance bottlenecks, preserve historical best versions, and iteratively refine code quality. We evaluate PRAGMA on KernelBench, covering GPU and CPU backends. Results show that PRAGMA consistently outperforms baseline AIKG without profiling enabled and achieves 2.81$\times$ and 2.30$\times$ averaged speedups against Torch on CPU and GPU platforms, respectively.

### [LLMServingSim2.0: A Unified Simulator for Heterogeneous Hardware and Serving Techniques in LLM Infrastructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07229)
**作者**：Jaehong Cho, Hyunmin Choi, Jongse Park

This paper introduces LLMServingSim2.0, a system simulator designed for exploring heterogeneous hardware in large-scale LLM serving systems. LLMServingSim2.0 addresses two key limitations of its predecessor: (1) integrating hardware models into system-level simulators is non-trivial due to the lack of a clear abstraction, and (2) existing simulators support only a narrow subset of serving techniques, leaving no infrastructure that captures the breadth of approaches in modern LLM serving. To overcome these issues, LLMServingSim2.0 adopts trace-driven performance modeling, accompanied by an operator-level latency profiler, enabling the integration of new accelerators with a single command. It further embeds up-to-date serving techniques while exposing flexible interfaces for request routing, cache management, and scheduling policies. In a TPU case study, our profiler requires 18.5x fewer LoC and outperforms the predecessor's hardware-simulator integration, demonstrating LLMServingSim2.0's low-effort hardware extensibility. Our experiments further show that LLMServingSim2.0 reproduces GPU-based LLM serving with 1.9% error, while maintaining practical simulation time, making it a comprehensive platform for both hardware developers and LLM service providers.

### [DMA Collectives for Efficient ML Communication Offloads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06605)
**作者**：Suchita Pati, Mahzabeen Islam, Shaizeen Aga, Mohamed Assem Ibrahim

Offloading machine learning (ML) communication collectives to direct memory access (DMA) engines has emerged as an interesting and low-cost solution to efficiently overlap computation and communication in inference and training. Doing so delivers superior concurrent performance by freeing up all GPU cores for computation and also lowers interference in the memory sub-system (caches). While DMA collectives show strong promise, prior works have only studied them in limited context (bandwidth-bound transfer sizes only, performance-only).  To address this, we provide a comprehensive performance, power/energy and synchronization costs analysis of offloading ML communication collectives (all-gather, all-to-all) to DMA engines on state-of-the-art AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs. Our analysis reveals that, compared to the state-of-the-art RCCL communication collectives library, DMA collectives are at-par or better for large sizes (10s of MB to GB) in terms of both performance (16% better) and power (32% better). However, they significantly lag for latency-bound small sizes; 4.5X and 2.5X slower for all-gather and all-to-all, respectively. We provide a detailed latency breakdown of a DMA transfer and identify that DMA command scheduling and synchronization costs can limit DMA collective performance. To tackle this, we harness existing DMA architecture innovations, hitherto untapped, to build optimized DMA collectives and demonstrate their efficacy on real hardware. Our optimized implementations considerably close the performance gap for DMA collectives at smaller sizes (30% slower and 20% faster all-gather and all-to-all, respectively) and further improves performance (by 7%) and power savings at larger sizes (3-10%). Overall, this work represents a significant step toward making DMA collectives suitable for adoption in mainstream collective libraries.

### [Wireless Sensor Networks Nodes Clustering and Optimization Based on Fuzzy C-Means and Water Strider Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06735)
**作者**：Raya Majid Alsharfa, Mahmood Mohassel Feghhi, Majid Hameed Majeed

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) face critical challenges in energy management and network lifetime optimization due to limited battery resources and communication overhead. This study introduces a novel hybrid clustering protocol that integrates the Water Strider Algorithm (WSA) with Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering to achieve superior energy efficiency and network longevity. The proposed WSA-FCM method employs WSA for global optimization of cluster- head positions and FCM for refined node membership assignment with fuzzy boundaries. Through extensive experimentation across networks of 200-800 nodes with 10 independent simulation runs, the method demonstrates significant improvements: First Node Death (FND) delayed by 16.1% ($678\pm12$ vs $584\pm18$ rounds), Last Node Death (LND) extended by 11.9% ($1,262\pm8$ vs $1,128\pm11$ rounds), and 37.4% higher residual energy retention ($5.47\pm0.09$ vs $3.98\pm0.11$ J) compared to state-of-the-art hybrid methods. Intra-cluster distances are reduced by 19.4% with statistical significance (p < 0.001). Theoretical analysis proves convergence guarantees and complexity bounds of $O(n\times c\times T)$, while empirical scalability analysis demonstrates near-linear scaling behaviour. The method outperforms recent hybrid approaches including MOALO-FCM, MSSO-MST, Fuzzy+HHO, and GWO-FCM across all performance metrics with rigorous statistical validation.

### [A GPU-boosted high-performance multi-working condition joint analysis framework for predicting dynamics of textured axial piston pump](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06824)
**作者**：Xin Yao, Yang Liu, Jin Jiang, Yesen Chen, Zhilong Chen, Hongkang Dong, Xiaofeng Wei, Teng Zhang, Dongyun Wang

Accurate simulation to dynamics of axial piston pump (APP) is essential for its design, manufacture and maintenance. However, limited by computation capacity of CPU device and traditional solvers, conventional iteration methods are inefficient in complicated case with textured surface requiring refined mesh, and could not handle simulation during multiple periods. To accelerate Picard iteration for predicting dynamics of APP, a GPU-boosted high-performance Multi-working condition joint Analysis Framework (GMAF) is designed, which adopts Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method (PCG) using Approximate Symmetric Successive Over-Relaxation preconditioner (ASSOR). GMAF abundantly utilizes GPU device via elevating computational intensity and expanding scale of massive parallel computation. Therefore, it possesses novel performance in analyzing dynamics of both smooth and textured APPs during multiple periods, as the establishment and solution to joint algebraic system for pressure field are accelerated magnificently, as well as numerical integral for force and moment due to oil flow. Compared with asynchronized convergence strategy pursuing local convergence, synchronized convergence strategy targeting global convergence is adopted in PCG solver for the joint system. Revealed by corresponding results, oil force in axial direction and moment in circumferential directly respond to input pressure, while other components evolve in sinusoidal patterns. Specifically, force and moment due to normal pressure instantly reach their steady state initially, while ones due to viscous shear stress evolve during periods. After simulating dynamics of APP and pressure distribution via GMAF, the promotion of pressure capacity and torsion resistance due to textured surface is revealed numerically, as several 'steps' exist in the pressure field corresponding to textures.

### [Resilient by Design - Active Inference for Distributed Continuum Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07202)
**作者**：Praveen Kumar Donta, Alfreds Lapkovskis, Enzo Mingozzi, Schahram Dustdar

Failures are the norm in highly complex and heterogeneous devices spanning the distributed computing continuum (DCC), from resource-constrained IoT and edge nodes to high-performance computing systems. Ensuring reliability and global consistency across these layers remains a major challenge, especially for AI-driven workloads requiring real-time, adaptive coordination. This paper introduces a Probabilistic Active Inference Resilience Agent (PAIR-Agent) to achieve resilience in DCC systems. PAIR-Agent performs three core operations: (i) constructing a causal fault graph from device logs, (ii) identifying faults while managing certainties and uncertainties using Markov blankets and the free-energy principle, and (iii) autonomously healing issues through active inference. Through continuous monitoring and adaptive reconfiguration, the agent maintains service continuity and stability under diverse failure conditions. Theoretical validations confirm the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed framework.

### [LLMs as Packagers of HPC Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05626)
**作者**：Caetano Melone, Daniel Nichols, Konstantinos Parasyris, Todd Gamblin, Harshitha Menon

High performance computing (HPC) software ecosystems are inherently heterogeneous, comprising scientific applications that depend on hundreds of external packages, each with distinct build systems, options, and dependency constraints. Tools such as Spack automate dependency resolution and environment management, but their effectiveness relies on manually written build recipes. As these ecosystems grow, maintaining existing specifications and creating new ones becomes increasingly labor-intensive. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in code generation, automatically producing correct and maintainable Spack recipes remains a significant challenge. We present a systematic analysis of how LLMs and context-augmentation methods can assist in the generation of Spack recipes. To this end, we introduce SpackIt, an end-to-end framework that combines repository analysis, retrieval of relevant examples, and iterative refinement through diagnostic feedback. We apply SpackIt to a representative subset of 308 open-source HPC packages to assess its effectiveness and limitations. Our results show that SpackIt increases installation success from 20% in a zero-shot setting to over 80% in its best configuration, demonstrating the value of retrieval and structured feedback for reliable package synthesis.

### [An Efficient Gradient-Aware Error-Bounded Lossy Compressor for Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05770)
**作者**：Zhijing Ye, Sheng Di, Jiamin Wang, Zhiqing Zhong, Zhaorui Zhang, Xiaodong Yu

Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without exposing clients' private data, but its deployment is often constrained by the communication cost of transmitting gradients between clients and the central server, especially under system heterogeneity where low-bandwidth clients bottleneck overall performance. Lossy compression of gradient data can mitigate this overhead, and error-bounded lossy compression (EBLC) is particularly appealing for its fine-grained utility-compression tradeoff. However, existing EBLC methods (e.g., SZ), originally designed for smooth scientific data with strong spatial locality, rely on generic predictors such as Lorenzo and interpolation for entropy reduction to improve compression ratio. Gradient tensors, in contrast, exhibit low smoothness and weak spatial correlation, rendering these predictors ineffective and leading to poor compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose an EBLC framework tailored for FL gradient data to achieve high compression ratios while preserving model accuracy. The core of it is an innovative prediction mechanism that exploits temporal correlations across FL training rounds and structural regularities within convolutional kernels to reduce residual entropy. The predictor is compatible with standard quantizers and entropy coders and comprises (1) a cross-round magnitude predictor based on a normalized exponential moving average, and (2) a sign predictor that leverages gradient oscillation and kernel-level sign consistency. Experiments show that this new EBLC yields up to 1.53x higher compression ratios than SZ3 with lower accuracy loss. Integrated into a real-world FL framework, APPFL, it reduces end-to-end communication time by 76.1%-96.2% under various constrained-bandwidth scenarios, demonstrating strong scalability for real-world FL deployments.

### [Efficient Dynamic MaxFlow Computation on GPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05895)
**作者**：Shruthi Kannappan, Ashwina Kumar, Rupesh Nasre

Maxflow is a fundamental problem in graph theory and combinatorial optimisation, used to determine the maximum flow from a source node to a sink node in a flow network. It finds applications in diverse domains, including computer networks, transportation, and image segmentation. The core idea is to maximise the total flow across the network without violating capacity constraints on edges and ensuring flow conservation at intermediate nodes. The rapid growth of unstructured and semi-structured data has motivated the development of parallel solutions to compute MaxFlow. However, due to the higher computational complexity, computing Maxflow for real-world graphs is time-consuming in practice. In addition, these graphs are dynamic and constantly evolve over time. In this work, we propose two Push-Relabel based algorithms for processing dynamic graphs on GPUs. The key novelty of our algorithms is their ability to efficiently handle both increments and decrements in edge capacities together when they appear in a batch. We illustrate the efficacy of our algorithms with a suite of real-world graphs. Overall, we find that for small updates, dynamic recomputation is significantly faster than a static GPU-based Maxflow.

### [Guidelines for Building Indexes on Partially Cache-Coherent CXL Shared Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06460)
**作者**：Fangnuo Wu, Mingkai Dong, Wenjun Cai, Jingsheng Yan, Haibo Chen

The \emph{Partial Cache-Coherence (PCC)} model maintains hardware cache coherence only within subsets of cores, enabling large-scale memory sharing with emerging memory interconnect technologies like Compute Express Link (CXL). However, PCC's relaxation of global cache coherence compromises the correctness of existing single-machine software.  This paper focuses on building consistent and efficient indexes on PCC platforms. We present that existing indexes designed for cache-coherent platforms can be made consistent on PCC platforms following SP guidelines, i.e., we identify \emph{sync-data} and \emph{protected-data} according to the index's concurrency control mechanisms, and synchronize them accordingly. However, conversion with SP guidelines introduces performance overhead. To mitigate the overhead, we identify several unique performance bottlenecks on PCC platforms, and propose P$^3$ guidelines (i.e., using Out-of-\underline{P}lace update, Re\underline{P}licated shared variable, S\underline{P}eculative Reading) to improve the efficiency of converted indexes on PCC platforms.  With SP and P$^3$ guidelines, we convert and optimize two indexes (CLevelHash and BwTree) for PCC platforms. Evaluation shows that converted indexes' throughput improves up to 16$\times$ following P$^3$ guidelines, and the optimized indexes outperform their message-passing-based and disaggregated-memory-based counterparts by up to 16$\times$ and 19$\times$.

### [GoCkpt: Gradient-Assisted Multi-Step overlapped Checkpointing for Efficient LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07035)
**作者**：Keyao Zhang, Yiquan Chen, Zhuo Hu, Wenhai Lin, Jiexiong Xu, Wenzhi Chen

The accuracy of large language models (LLMs) improves with increasing model size, but increasing model complexity also poses significant challenges to training stability. Periodic checkpointing is a key mechanism for fault recovery and is widely used in LLM training. However, traditional checkpointing strategies often pause or delay GPU computation during checkpoint saving for checkpoint GPU-CPU transfer, resulting in significant training interruptions and reduced training throughput. To address this issue, we propose GoCkpt, a method to overlap checkpoint saving with multiple training steps and restore the final checkpoint on the CPU. We transfer the checkpoint across multiple steps, each step transfers part of the checkpoint state, and we transfer some of the gradient data used for parameter updates. After the transfer is complete, each partial checkpoint state is updated to a consistent version on the CPU, thus avoiding the checkpoint state inconsistency problem caused by transferring checkpoints across multiple steps. Furthermore, we introduce a transfer optimization strategy to maximize GPU-CPU bandwidth utilization and SSD persistence throughput. This dual optimization overlapping saves across steps and maximizing I/O efficiency significantly reduces invalid training time. Experimental results show that GoCkpt can increase training throughput by up to 38.4% compared to traditional asynchronous checkpoint solutions in the industry. We also find that GoCkpt can reduce training interruption time by 86.7% compared to the state-of-the-art checkpoint transfer methods, which results in a 4.8% throughput improvement.
