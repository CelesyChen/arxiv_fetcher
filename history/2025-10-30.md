### [The influence of the random numbers quality on the results in stochastic simulations and machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25269)
**作者**：Benjamin A. Antunes (LIRMM | DALI)

Pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) are ubiquitous in stochastic simulations and machine learning (ML), where they drive sampling, parameter initialization, regularization, and data shuffling. While widely used, the potential impact of PRNG statistical quality on computational results remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate whether differences in PRNG quality, as measured by standard statistical test suites, can influence outcomes in representative stochastic applications. Seven PRNGs were evaluated, ranging from low-quality linear congruential generators (LCGs) with known statistical deficiencies to high-quality generators such as Mersenne Twister, PCG, and Philox. We applied these PRNGs to four distinct tasks: an epidemiological agent-based model (ABM), two independent from-scratch MNIST classification implementations (Python/NumPy and C++), and a reinforcement learning (RL) CartPole environment. Each experiment was repeated 30 times per generator using fixed seeds to ensure reproducibility, and outputs were compared using appropriate statistical analyses. Results show that very poor statistical quality, as in the ''bad'' LCG failing 125 TestU01 Crush tests, produces significant deviations in ABM epidemic dynamics, reduces MNIST classification accuracy, and severely degrades RL performance. In contrast, mid-and good-quality LCGs-despite failing a limited number of Crush or BigCrush tests-performed comparably to top-tier PRNGs in most tasks, with the RL experiment being the primary exception where performance scaled with statistical quality. Our findings indicate that, once a generator meets a sufficient statistical robustness threshold, its family or design has negligible impact on outcomes for most workloads, allowing selection to be guided by performance and implementation considerations. However, the use of low-quality PRNGs in sensitive stochastic computations can introduce substantial and systematic errors.

### [Sub-microsecond Transformers for Jet Tagging on FPGAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24784)
**作者**：Lauri Laatu, Chang Sun, Arianna Cox, Abhijith Gandrakota, Benedikt Maier, Jennifer Ngadiuba, Zhiqiang Que, Wayne Luk, Maria Spiropulu, Alexander Tapper

We present the first sub-microsecond transformer implementation on an FPGA achieving competitive performance for state-of-the-art high-energy physics benchmarks. Transformers have shown exceptional performance on multiple tasks in modern machine learning applications, including jet tagging at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). However, their computational complexity prohibits use in real-time applications, such as the hardware trigger system of the collider experiments up until now. In this work, we demonstrate the first application of transformers for jet tagging on FPGAs, achieving $\mathcal{O}(100)$ nanosecond latency with superior performance compared to alternative baseline models. We leverage high-granularity quantization and distributed arithmetic optimization to fit the entire transformer model on a single FPGA, achieving the required throughput and latency. Furthermore, we add multi-head attention and linear attention support to hls4ml, making our work accessible to the broader fast machine learning community. This work advances the next-generation trigger systems for the High Luminosity LHC, enabling the use of transformers for real-time applications in high-energy physics and beyond.

### [A Study on Inference Latency for Vision Transformers on Mobile Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25166)
**作者**：Zhuojin Li, Marco Paolieri, Leana Golubchik

Given the significant advances in machine learning techniques on mobile devices, particularly in the domain of computer vision, in this work we quantitatively study the performance characteristics of 190 real-world vision transformers (ViTs) on mobile devices. Through a comparison with 102 real-world convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we provide insights into the factors that influence the latency of ViT architectures on mobile devices. Based on these insights, we develop a dataset including measured latencies of 1000 synthetic ViTs with representative building blocks and state-of-the-art architectures from two machine learning frameworks and six mobile platforms. Using this dataset, we show that inference latency of new ViTs can be predicted with sufficient accuracy for real-world applications.

### [Score-Aware Policy-Gradient and Performance Guarantees using Local Lyapunov Stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02804)
**作者**：C\'eline Comte, Matthieu Jonckheere, Jaron Sanders, Albert Senen-Cerda

In this paper, we introduce a policy-gradient method for model-based reinforcement learning (RL) that exploits a type of stationary distributions commonly obtained from Markov decision processes (MDPs) in stochastic networks, queueing systems, and statistical mechanics. Specifically, when the stationary distribution of the MDP belongs to an exponential family that is parametrized by policy parameters, we can improve existing policy gradient methods for average-reward RL. Our key identification is a family of gradient estimators, called score-aware gradient estimators (SAGEs), that enable policy gradient estimation without relying on value-function estimation in the aforementioned setting. We show that SAGE-based policy-gradient locally converges, and we obtain its regret. This includes cases when the state space of the MDP is countable and unstable policies can exist. Under appropriate assumptions such as starting sufficiently close to a maximizer and the existence of a local Lyapunov function, the policy under SAGE-based stochastic gradient ascent has an overwhelming probability of converging to the associated optimal policy. Furthermore, we conduct a numerical comparison between a SAGE-based policy-gradient method and an actor-critic method on several examples inspired from stochastic networks, queueing systems, and models derived from statistical physics. Our results demonstrate that a SAGE-based method finds close-to-optimal policies faster than an actor-critic method.

### [DIRC-RAG: Accelerating Edge RAG with Robust High-Density and High-Loading-Bandwidth Digital In-ReRAM Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25278)
**作者**：Kunming Shao, Zhipeng Liao, Jiangnan Yu, Liang Zhao, Qiwei Li, Xijie Huang, Jingyu He, Fengshi Tian, Yi Zou, Xiaomeng Wang, Tim Kwang-Ting Cheng, Chi-Ying Tsui

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge retrieval but faces challenges on edge devices due to high storage, energy, and latency demands. Computing-in-Memory (CIM) offers a promising solution by storing document embeddings in CIM macros and enabling in-situ parallel retrievals but is constrained by either low memory density or limited computational accuracy. To address these challenges, we present DIRCRAG, a novel edge RAG acceleration architecture leveraging Digital In-ReRAM Computation (DIRC). DIRC integrates a high-density multi-level ReRAM subarray with an SRAM cell, utilizing SRAM and differential sensing for robust ReRAM readout and digital multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. By storing all document embeddings within the CIM macro, DIRC achieves ultra-low-power, single-cycle data loading, substantially reducing both energy consumption and latency compared to offchip DRAM. A query-stationary (QS) dataflow is supported for RAG tasks, minimizing on-chip data movement and reducing SRAM buffer requirements. We introduce error optimization for the DIRC ReRAM-SRAM cell by extracting the bit-wise spatial error distribution of the ReRAM subarray and applying targeted bit-wise data remapping. An error detection circuit is also implemented to enhance readout resilience against deviceand circuit-level variations. Simulation results demonstrate that DIRC-RAG under TSMC40nm process achieves an on-chip non-volatile memory density of 5.18Mb/mm2 and a throughput of 131 TOPS. It delivers a 4MB retrieval latency of 5.6{\mu}s/query and an energy consumption of 0.956{\mu}J/query, while maintaining the retrieval precision.

### [Resource-Efficient and Robust Inference of Deep and Bayesian Neural Networks on Embedded and Analog Computing Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24951)
**作者**：Bernhard Klein

While modern machine learning has transformed numerous application domains, its growing computational demands increasingly constrain scalability and efficiency, particularly on embedded and resource-limited platforms. In practice, neural networks must not only operate efficiently but also provide reliable predictions under distributional shifts or unseen data. Bayesian neural networks offer a principled framework for quantifying uncertainty, yet their computational overhead further compounds these challenges.  This work advances resource-efficient and robust inference for both conventional and Bayesian neural networks through the joint pursuit of algorithmic and hardware efficiency. The former reduces computation through model compression and approximate Bayesian inference, while the latter optimizes deployment on digital accelerators and explores analog hardware, bridging algorithmic design and physical realization. The first contribution, Galen, performs automatic layer-specific compression guided by sensitivity analysis and hardware-in-the-loop feedback. Analog accelerators offer efficiency gains at the cost of noise; this work models device imperfections and extends noisy training to nonstationary conditions, improving robustness and stability. A second line of work advances probabilistic inference, developing analytic and ensemble approximations that replace costly sampling, integrate into a compiler stack, and optimize embedded inference. Finally, probabilistic photonic computing introduces a paradigm where controlled analog noise acts as an intrinsic entropy source, enabling fast, energy-efficient probabilistic inference directly in hardware.  Together, these studies demonstrate how efficiency and reliability can be advanced jointly through algorithm-hardware co-design, laying the foundation for the next generation of trustworthy, energy-efficient machine-learning systems.

### [Silicon-based Josephson junction field-effect transistors enabling cryogenic logic and quantum technologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25208)
**作者**：Yusheng Xiong, Kaveh Delfanazari

The continuous miniaturisation of metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) from long- to short-channel architectures has advanced beyond the predictions of Moore's Law. Continued advances in semiconductor electronics, even near current scaling and performance boundaries under cryogenic conditions, are driving the development of innovative device paradigms that enable ultra-low-power and high-speed functionality. Among emerging candidates, the Josephson Junction Field-Effect Transistor (JJFET or JoFET) provides an alternative by integrating superconducting source and drain electrodes for efficient, phase-coherent operation at ultra-low temperatures. These hybrid devices have the potential to bridge conventional semiconductor electronics with cryogenic logic and quantum circuits, enabling energy-efficient and high-coherence signal processing across temperature domains. This review traces the evolution from Josephson junctions to field-effect transistors, emphasising the structural and functional innovations that underpin modern device scalability. The performance and material compatibility of JJFETs fabricated on Si, GaAs, and InGaAs substrates are analysed, alongside an assessment of their switching dynamics and material compatibility. Particular attention is given to superconductor-silicon-superconductor Josephson junctions as the active core of JJFET architectures. By unfolding more than four decades of experimental progress, this work highlights the promise of JJFETs as foundational building blocks for next-generation cryogenic logic and quantum electronic systems.

### [Accurate Leakage Speculation for Quantum Error Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25661)
**作者**：Chaithanya Naik Mude, Swamit Tannu

Quantum Error Correction (QEC) protects qubits against bit- and phase-flip errors in the |0> or |1> subspace, but physical qubits can also leak into higher energy levels (e.g., |2>). Leakage is especially harmful, as it corrupts all subsequent syndrome measurements and can spread to neighboring qubits. Detecting leakage on data qubits is particularly challenging, since they are never measured directly during QEC cycles. Prior work, such as eraser, addresses this by inferring leakage from syndrome patterns using a fixed heuristic. However, this approach often misclassifies benign syndromes, triggering excessive leakage-reduction circuits (LRCs). Because LRCs are themselves noisy and slow, these false triggers lengthen QEC cycles and inflate logical error rates.  We propose gladiator, a general and adaptable leakage speculation framework that works across surface code, color code, and qLDPC codes. Offline, gladiator builds a code-aware error-propagation graph calibrated to device data. Online, it classifies each syndrome in a few nanoseconds and schedules LRC only when the observed pattern is provably leakage-dominated. This precise speculation eliminates up to 3x (and on average 2x) unnecessary LRCs, shortens QEC cycles, and suppresses false positives at their source. Evaluated on standard fault-tolerant benchmarks, gladiator delivers 1.7x-3.9x speedups and 16% reduction in logical error rate, advancing the efficiency of fault-tolerant quantum computing.

### [Radar DataTree: A FAIR and Cloud-Native Framework for Scalable Weather Radar Archives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24943)
**作者**：Alfonso Ladino-Rincon, Stephen W. Nesbitt

We introduce Radar DataTree, the first dataset-level framework that extends the WMO FM-301 standard from individual radar volume scans to time-resolved, analysis-ready archives. Weather radar data are among the most scientifically valuable yet structurally underutilized Earth observation datasets. Despite widespread public availability, radar archives remain fragmented, vendor-specific, and poorly aligned with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles, hindering large-scale research, reproducibility, and cloud-native computation. Radar DataTree addresses these limitations with a scalable, open-source architecture that transforms operational radar archives into FAIR-compliant, cloud-optimized datasets. Built on the FM-301/CfRadial 2.1 standard and implemented using xarray DataTree, Radar DataTree organizes radar volume scans as hierarchical, metadata-rich structures and serializes them to Zarr for scalable analysis. Coupled with Icechunk for ACID-compliant storage and versioning, this architecture enables efficient, parallel computation across thousands of radar scans with minimal preprocessing. We demonstrate significant performance gains in case studies including Quasi-Vertical Profile (QVP) and precipitation accumulation workflows, and release all tools and datasets openly via the Raw2Zarr repository. This work contributes a reproducible and extensible foundation for radar data stewardship, high-performance geoscience, and AI-ready weather infrastructure.

### [Multi-Resolution Model Fusion for Accelerating the Convolutional Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25170)
**作者**：Kewei Wang, Claire Songhyun Lee, Sunwoo Lee, Vishu Gupta, Jan Balewski, Alex Sim, Peter Nugent, Ankit Agrawal, Alok Choudhary, Kesheng Wu, Wei-keng Liao

Neural networks are rapidly gaining popularity in scientific research, but training the models is often very time-consuming. Particularly when the training data samples are large high-dimensional arrays, efficient training methodologies that can reduce the computational costs are crucial. To reduce the training cost, we propose a Multi-Resolution Model Fusion (MRMF) method that combines models trained on reduced-resolution data and then refined with data in the original resolution. We demonstrate that these reduced-resolution models and datasets could be generated quickly. More importantly, the proposed approach reduces the training time by speeding up the model convergence in each fusion stage before switching to the final stage of finetuning with data in its original resolution. This strategy ensures the final model retains high-resolution insights while benefiting from the computational efficiency of lower-resolution training. Our experiment results demonstrate that the multi-resolution model fusion method can significantly reduce end-to-end training time while maintaining the same model accuracy. Evaluated using two real-world scientific applications, CosmoFlow and Neuron Inverter, the proposed method improves the training time by up to 47% and 44%, respectively, as compared to the original resolution training, while the model accuracy is not affected.

### [MoEntwine: Unleashing the Potential of Wafer-scale Chips for Large-scale Expert Parallel Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25258)
**作者**：Xinru Tang, Jingxiang Hou, Dingcheng Jiang, Taiquan Wei, Jiaxin Liu, Jinyi Deng, Huizheng Wang, Qize Yang, Haoran Shang, Chao Li, Yang Hu, Shouyi Yin

As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale up, mixture-of-experts (MoE) has become a common technology in SOTA models. MoE models rely on expert parallelism (EP) to alleviate memory bottleneck, which introduces all-to-all communication to dispatch and combine tokens across devices. However, in widely-adopted GPU clusters, high-overhead cross-node communication makes all-to-all expensive, hindering the adoption of EP. Recently, wafer-scale chips (WSCs) have emerged as a platform integrating numerous devices on a wafer-sized interposer. WSCs provide a unified high-performance network connecting all devices, presenting a promising potential for hosting MoE models. Yet, their network is restricted to a mesh topology, causing imbalanced communication pressure and performance loss. Moreover, the lack of on-wafer disk leads to high-overhead expert migration on the critical path.  To fully unleash this potential, we first propose Entwined Ring Mapping (ER-Mapping), which co-designs the mapping of attention and MoE layers to balance communication pressure and achieve better performance. We find that under ER-Mapping, the distribution of cold and hot links in the attention and MoE layers is complementary. Therefore, to hide the migration overhead, we propose the Non-invasive Balancer (NI-Balancer), which splits a complete expert migration into multiple steps and alternately utilizes the cold links of both layers. Evaluation shows ER-Mapping achieves communication reduction up to 62%. NI-Balancer further delivers 54% and 22% improvements in MoE computation and communication, respectively. Compared with the SOTA NVL72 supernode, the WSC platform delivers an average 39% higher per-device MoE performance owing to its scalability to larger EP.

### [A Privacy-Preserving Ecosystem for Developing Machine Learning Algorithms Using Patient Data: Insights from the TUM.ai Makeathon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25277)
**作者**：Simon S\"uwer, Mai Khanh Mai, Christoph Klein, Nicola G\"otzenberger, Denis Dali\'c, Andreas Maier, Jan Baumbach

The integration of clinical data offers significant potential for the development of personalized medicine. However, its use is severely restricted by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), especially for small cohorts with rare diseases. High-quality, structured data is essential for the development of predictive medical AI. In this case study, we propose a novel, multi-stage approach to secure AI training: (1) The model is designed on a simulated clinical knowledge graph (cKG). This graph is used exclusively to represent the structural characteristics of the real cKG without revealing any sensitive content. (2) The model is then integrated into the FeatureCloud (FC) federated learning framework, where it is prepared in a single-client configuration within a protected execution environment. (3) Training then takes place within the hospital environment on the real cKG, either under the direct supervision of hospital staff or via a fully automated pipeline controlled by the hospital. (4) Finally, verified evaluation scripts are executed, which only return aggregated performance metrics. This enables immediate performance feedback without sensitive patient data or individual predictions, leaving the clinic. A fundamental element of this approach involves the incorporation of a cKG, which serves to organize multi-omics and patient data within the context of real-world hospital environments. This approach was successfully validated during the TUM.ai Makeathon 2024 (TUMaiM24) challenge set by the Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital (HCH-LMU): 50 students developed models for patient classification and diagnosis without access to real data. Deploying secure algorithms via federated frameworks, such as the FC framework, could be a practical way of achieving privacy-preserving AI in healthcare.

### [Scheduling Data-Intensive Workloads in Large-Scale Distributed Systems: Trends and Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25362)
**作者**：Georgios L. Stavrinides, Helen D. Karatza

With the explosive growth of big data, workloads tend to get more complex and computationally demanding. Such applications are processed on distributed interconnected resources that are becoming larger in scale and computational capacity. Data-intensive applications may have different degrees of parallelism and must effectively exploit data locality. Furthermore, they may impose several Quality of Service requirements, such as time constraints and resilience against failures, as well as other objectives, like energy efficiency. These features of the workloads, as well as the inherent characteristics of the computing resources required to process them, present major challenges that require the employment of effective scheduling techniques. In this chapter, a classification of data-intensive workloads is proposed and an overview of the most commonly used approaches for their scheduling in large-scale distributed systems is given. We present novel strategies that have been proposed in the literature and shed light on open challenges and future directions.

### [Holon Streaming: Global Aggregations with Windowed CRDTs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25757)
**作者**：Jonas Spenger, Kolya Krafeld, Ruben van Gemeren, Philipp Haller, Paris Carbone

Scaling global aggregations is a challenge for exactly-once stream processing systems. Current systems implement these either by computing the aggregation in a single task instance, or by static aggregation trees, which limits scalability and may become a bottleneck. Moreover, the end-to-end latency is determined by the slowest path in the tree, and failures and reconfiguration cause large latency spikes due to the centralized coordination. Towards these issues, we present Holon Streaming, an exactly-once stream processing system for global aggregations. Its deterministic programming model uses windowed conflict-free replicated data types (Windowed CRDTs), a novel abstraction for shared replicated state. Windowed CRDTs make computing global aggregations scalable. Furthermore, their guarantees such as determinism and convergence enable the design of efficient failure recovery algorithms by decentralized coordination. Our evaluation shows a 5x lower latency and 2x higher throughput than an existing stream processing system on global aggregation workloads, with an 11x latency reduction under failure scenarios. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of decentralized coordination with determinism, and the utility of Windowed CRDTs for global aggregations.

### [Synchronization in Anonymous Networks Under Arbitrary Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08661)
**作者**：Rida Bazzi, Cameron Bickley, Anya Chaturvedi, Andr\'ea W. Richa, Peter Vargas

We present the $\delta$-Synchronizer, which works in non-synchronous dynamic networks under minimal assumptions. Our model allows for arbitrary topological changes without any guarantee of eventual global or partial stabilization and assumes that nodes are anonymous. This deterministic synchronizer is the first that enables nodes to simulate a dynamic network synchronous algorithm for executions in a semi-synchronous dynamic environment under a weakly-fair node activation scheduler, despite the absence of a global clock, node ids, persistent connectivity or any assumptions about the edge dynamics (in both the synchronous and semi-synchronous environments). We make the following contributions: (1) we extend the definition of synchronizers to networks with arbitrary edge dynamics; (2) we present the first synchronizer from the semi-synchronous to the synchronous model in such networks; and (3) we present non-trivial applications of the proposed synchronizer to existing algorithms. We assume an extension of the Pull communication model by adding a single 1-bit multi-writer atomic register at each edge-port of a node. We show that this extension is needed and that synchronization in our setting is not possible without it. The $\delta$-Synchronizer operates with a multiplicative memory overhead at the nodes that is asymptotically logarithmic on the runtime of the underlying synchronous algorithm being simulated-in particular, it is logarithmic for polynomial-time synchronous algorithms.

### [Can Like Attract Like? A Study of Homonymous Gathering in Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25451)
**作者**：St\'ephane Devismes, Yoann Dieudonn\'e, Arnaud Labourel

A team of mobile agents, starting from distinct nodes of a network, have to meet at the same node and declare that they all met. Agents execute the same algorithm, which they start when activated by an adversary or by an agent entering their initial node. When activated, agents traverse edges of the network in synchronous rounds. Their perception and communication are strictly local. This task, known as gathering, is a central problem in distributed mobile systems. Most prior work focuses on minimizing its time complexity, i.e., the worst-case number of rounds between the start of the earliest agent and the task completion. To break possible symmetries, deterministic solutions typically assume that agents have pairwise distinct IDs, called labels, known only to themselves. But must all labels be pairwise distinct to guarantee deterministic gathering?  We address this question by considering agents that may share the same label. A team L is said to be gatherable if, for every initial setting of L, there is an algorithm that solves gathering. Our contribution is threefold. (1) We give a full characterization of the gatherable teams. (2) We design an algorithm that gathers all of them in poly$(n,\log\lambda)$ time, where $n$ (resp. $\lambda$) is the graph order (resp. the smallest label in L). This algorithm requires the agents to initially share only $O(\log \log \log \mu)$ bits of common knowledge, where $\mu$ is the largest label multiplicity in L. (3) We show this dependency is almost optimal to get a poly$(n,\log\lambda)$-time complexity.  As a by-product, we get the first deterministic poly$(n,\log\lambda)$-time algorithm requiring no common knowledge to gather any team when all labels are distinct. Known to be achievable for two-agent teams, extending this to any team size faced a major challenge: termination detection. Our techniques to address it may be of independent interest.

### [Large-Scale Network Embedding in Apache Spark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10620)
**作者**：Wenqing Lin

Network embedding has been widely used in social recommendation and network analysis, such as recommendation systems and anomaly detection with graphs. However, most of previous approaches cannot handle large graphs efficiently, due to that (i) computation on graphs is often costly and (ii) the size of graph or the intermediate results of vectors could be prohibitively large, rendering it difficult to be processed on a single machine. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective distributed algorithm for network embedding on large graphs using Apache Spark, which recursively partitions a graph into several small-sized subgraphs to capture the internal and external structural information of nodes, and then computes the network embedding for each subgraph in parallel. Finally, by aggregating the outputs on all subgraphs, we obtain the embeddings of nodes in a linear cost. After that, we demonstrate in various experiments that our proposed approach is able to handle graphs with billions of edges within a few hours and is at least 4 times faster than the state-of-the-art approaches. Besides, it achieves up to $4.25\%$ and $4.27\%$ improvements on link prediction and node classification tasks respectively. In the end, we deploy the proposed algorithms in two online games of Tencent with the applications of friend recommendation and item recommendation, which improve the competitors by up to $91.11\%$ in running time and up to $12.80\%$ in the corresponding evaluation metrics.

### [CFL-SparseMed: Communication-Efficient Federated Learning for Medical Imaging with Top-k Sparse Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24776)
**作者**：Gousia Habib, Aniket Bhardwaj, Ritvik Sharma, Shoeib Amin Banday, Ishfaq Ahmad Malik

Secure and reliable medical image classification is crucial for effective patient treatment, but centralized models face challenges due to data and privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborations but struggles with heterogeneous, non-IID data and high communication costs, especially in large networks. We propose \textbf{CFL-SparseMed}, an FL approach that uses Top-k Sparsification to reduce communication overhead by transmitting only the top k gradients. This unified solution effectively addresses data heterogeneity while maintaining model accuracy. It enhances FL efficiency, preserves privacy, and improves diagnostic accuracy and patient care in non-IID medical imaging settings. The reproducibility source code is available on \href{https://github.com/Aniket2241/APK_contruct}{Github}.

### [The Singularity Theory of Concurrent Programs: A Topological Characterization and Detection of Deadlocks and Livelocks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25112)
**作者**：Di Zhang

This paper introduces a novel paradigm for the analysis and verification of concurrent programs -- the Singularity Theory. We model the execution space of a concurrent program as a branched topological space, where program states are points and state transitions are paths. Within this framework, we characterize deadlocks as attractors and livelocks as non-contractible loops in the execution space. By employing tools from algebraic topology, particularly homotopy and homology groups, we define a series of concurrent topological invariants to systematically detect and classify these concurrent "singularities" without exhaustively traversing all states. This work aims to establish a geometric and topological foundation for concurrent program verification, transcending the limitations of traditional model checking.

### [Timing Games in Responsive Consensus Protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25144)
**作者**：Kaya Alpturer, Kushal Babel, Aditya Saraf

Optimistic responsiveness -- the ability of a consensus protocol to operate at the speed of the network -- is widely used in consensus protocol design to optimize latency and throughput. However, blockchain applications incentivize validators to play timing games by strategically delaying their proposals, since increased block time correlates with greater rewards. Consequently, it may appear that responsiveness (even under optimistic conditions) is impossible in blockchain protocols. In this work, we develop a model of timing games in responsive consensus protocols and find a prisoner's dilemma structure, where cooperation (proposing promptly) is in the validators' best interest, but individual incentives encourage validators to delay proposals selfishly. To attain desirable equilibria, we introduce dynamic block rewards that decrease with round time to explicitly incentivize faster proposals. Delays are measured through a voting mechanism, where other validators vote on the current leader's round time. By carefully setting the protocol parameters, the voting mechanism allows validators to coordinate and reach the cooperative equilibrium, benefiting all through a higher rate-of-reward. Thus, instead of responsiveness being an unattainable property due to timing games, we show that responsiveness itself can promote faster block proposals. One consequence of moving from a static to dynamic block reward is that validator utilities become more sensitive to latency, worsening the gap between the best- and worst-connected validators. Our analysis shows, however, that this effect is minor in both theoretical latency models and simulations based on real-world networks.

### [Machine Learning and CPU (Central Processing Unit) Scheduling Co-Optimization over a Network of Computing Centers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25176)
**作者**：Mohammadreza Doostmohammadian, Zulfiya R. Gabidullina, Hamid R. Rabiee

In the rapidly evolving research on artificial intelligence (AI) the demand for fast, computationally efficient, and scalable solutions has increased in recent years. The problem of optimizing the computing resources for distributed machine learning (ML) and optimization is considered in this paper. Given a set of data distributed over a network of computing-nodes/servers, the idea is to optimally assign the CPU (central processing unit) usage while simultaneously training each computing node locally via its own share of data. This formulates the problem as a co-optimization setup to (i) optimize the data processing and (ii) optimally allocate the computing resources. The information-sharing network among the nodes might be time-varying, but with balanced weights to ensure consensus-type convergence of the algorithm. The algorithm is all-time feasible, which implies that the computing resource-demand balance constraint holds at all iterations of the proposed solution. Moreover, the solution allows addressing possible log-scale quantization over the information-sharing channels to exchange log-quantized data. For some example applications, distributed support-vector-machine (SVM) and regression are considered as the ML training models. Results from perturbation theory, along with Lyapunov stability and eigen-spectrum analysis, are used to prove the convergence towards the optimal case. As compared to existing CPU scheduling solutions, the proposed algorithm improves the cost optimality gap by more than $50\%$.

### [Effect of Full Common Randomness Replication in Symmetric PIR on Graph-Based Replicated Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25736)
**作者**：Shreya Meel, Sennur Ulukus

We revisit the problem of symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) in settings where the database replication is modeled by a simple graph. Here, each vertex corresponds to a server, and a message is replicated on two servers if and only if there is an edge between them. To satisfy the requirement of database privacy, we let all the servers share some common randomness, independent of the messages. We aim to quantify the improvement in SPIR capacity, i.e., the maximum ratio of the number of desired and downloaded symbols, compared to the setting with graph-replicated common randomness. Towards this, we develop an algorithm to convert a class of PIR schemes into the corresponding SPIR schemes, thereby establishing a capacity lower bound on graphs for which such schemes exist. This includes the class of path and cyclic graphs for which we derive capacity upper bounds that are tighter than the trivial bounds given by the respective PIR capacities. For the special case of path graph with three vertices, we identify the SPIR capacity to be $\frac{1}{2}$.

Foundation models demand advanced data processing for their vast, multimodal datasets. However, traditional frameworks struggle with the unique complexities of multimodal data. In response, we present Data-Juicer 2.0, a data processing system backed by 100+ data processing operators spanning text, image, video, and audio modalities, supporting more critical tasks including data analysis, synthesis, annotation, and foundation model post-training. With seamless compatibility and dedicated optimization for popular dataset hubs like Hugging Face and computing engines like Ray, it improves upon its predecessor in terms of usability, efficiency, and programmability. It features an easily accessible user interface layer that supports decoupled Python interactions, RESTful APIs, and conversational commands. Its new runtime layer offers adaptive execution across diverse scales and environments, abstracting away system complexities. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate Data-Juicer 2.0's remarkable performance and scalability, highlighting its capability to efficiently process TB-level data with 10k+ CPU cores. The system is publicly available and has been widely adopted in diverse research fields and real-world products such as Alibaba Cloud PAI. We actively maintain the system and share practical insights to foster research and applications of next-generation foundation models.

Machine Learning (ML) is profoundly reshaping the way researchers create, implement, and operate data-intensive software. Its adoption, however, introduces notable challenges for computing infrastructures, particularly when it comes to coordinating access to hardware accelerators across development, testing, and production environments. The INFN initiative AI_INFN (Artificial Intelligence at INFN) seeks to promote the use of ML methods across various INFN research scenarios by offering comprehensive technical support, including access to AI-focused computational resources. Leveraging the INFN Cloud ecosystem and cloud-native technologies, the project emphasizes efficient sharing of accelerator hardware while maintaining the breadth of the Institute's research activities. This contribution describes the deployment and commissioning of a Kubernetes-based platform designed to simplify GPU-powered data analysis workflows and enable their scalable execution on heterogeneous distributed resources. By integrating offloading mechanisms through Virtual Kubelet and the InterLink API, the platform allows workflows to span multiple resource providers, from Worldwide LHC Computing Grid sites to high-performance computing centers like CINECA Leonardo. We will present preliminary benchmarks, functional tests, and case studies, demonstrating both performance and integration outcomes.

### [Amnesiac Flooding: Easy to break, hard to escape](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06001)
**作者**：Henry Austin, Maximilien Gadouleau, George B. Mertzios, Amitabh Trehan

Broadcast is a central problem in distributed computing. Recently, Hussak and Trehan [PODC'19/DC'23] proposed a stateless broadcasting protocol (Amnesiac Flooding), which was surprisingly proven to terminate in asymptotically optimal time (linear in the diameter of the network). However, it remains unclear: (i) Are there other stateless terminating broadcast algorithms with the desirable properties of Amnesiac Flooding, (ii) How robust is Amnesiac Flooding with respect to \emph{faults}?  In this paper we make progress on both of these fronts. Under a reasonable restriction (obliviousness to message content) additional to the fault-free synchronous model, we prove that Amnesiac Flooding is the \emph{only} strictly stateless deterministic protocol that can achieve terminating broadcast. We achieve this by identifying four natural properties of a terminating broadcast protocol that Amnesiac Flooding uniquely satisfies. In contrast, we prove that even minor relaxations of \textit{any} of these four criteria allow the construction of other terminating broadcast protocols.  On the other hand, we prove that Amnesiac Flooding can become non-terminating or non-broadcasting, even if we allow just one node to drop a single message on a single edge in a single round. As a tool for proving this, we focus on the set of all \textit{configurations} of transmissions between nodes in the network, and obtain a \textit{dichotomy} characterizing the configurations, starting from which, Amnesiac Flooding terminates.  Additionally, we characterise the structure of sets of Byzantine agents capable of forcing non-termination or non-broadcast of the protocol on arbitrary networks.

### [New Limits on Distributed Quantum Advantage: Dequantizing Linear Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07574)

In this work, we give two results that put new limits on distributed quantum advantage in the context of the LOCAL model of distributed computing. First, we show that there is no distributed quantum advantage for any linear program. Put otherwise, if there is a quantum-LOCAL algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ that finds an $\alpha$-approximation of some linear optimization problem $\Pi$ in $T$ communication rounds, we can construct a classical, deterministic LOCAL algorithm $\mathcal{A}'$ that finds an $\alpha$-approximation of $\Pi$ in $T$ rounds. As a corollary, all classical lower bounds for linear programs, including the KMW bound, hold verbatim in quantum-LOCAL. Second, using the above result, we show that there exists a locally checkable labeling problem (LCL) for which quantum-LOCAL is strictly weaker than the classical deterministic SLOCAL model. Our results extend from quantum-LOCAL also to finitely dependent and non-signaling distributions, and one of the corollaries of our work is that the non-signaling model and the SLOCAL model are incomparable in the context of LCL problems: By prior work, there exists an LCL problem for which SLOCAL is strictly weaker than the non-signaling model, and our work provides a separation in the opposite direction.

### [Odontoceti: Ultra-Fast DAG Consensus with Two Round Commitment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01216)
**作者**：Preston Vander Vos

Users of blockchains value scalability, expecting fast confirmations and immediate transaction processing. Odontoceti, the latest in DAG-based consensus, addresses these concerns by prioritizing low latency and high throughput, making a strategic trade-off in security by operating with a 20% fault tolerance instead of the established 33% level. It is the first DAG-based protocol to achieve commitment in just two communication rounds, delivering median latency of 300 milliseconds while processing 10,000 transactions per second under realistic network conditions. Odontoceti operates with n = 5f + 1 validators and creates an uncertified DAG with a novel decision rule for committing blocks. The protocol includes an optimization that advances progress when participants are slow, benefiting crash fault scenarios which are more common in practice than Byzantine faults. Evaluation results demonstrate 20-25% latency improvements compared to an existing production protocol, validating that reducing wave length from three rounds to two rounds yields meaningful performance benefits. This paper establishes the practical viability of lower fault tolerance consensus protocols for blockchains.
