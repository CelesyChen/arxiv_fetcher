### [Efficient Chromosome Parallelization for Precision Medicine Genomic Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15977)
**作者**：Daniel Mas Montserrat, Ray Verma, M\'iriam Barrab\'es, Francisco M. de la Vega, Carlos D. Bustamante, Alexander G. Ioannidis

Large-scale genomic workflows used in precision medicine can process datasets spanning tens to hundreds of gigabytes per sample, leading to high memory spikes, intensive disk I/O, and task failures due to out-of-memory errors. Simple static resource allocation methods struggle to handle the variability in per-chromosome RAM demands, resulting in poor resource utilization and long runtimes. In this work, we propose multiple mechanisms for adaptive, RAM-efficient parallelization of chromosome-level bioinformatics workflows. First, we develop a symbolic regression model that estimates per-chromosome memory consumption for a given task and introduces an interpolating bias to conservatively minimize over-allocation. Second, we present a dynamic scheduler that adaptively predicts RAM usage with a polynomial regression model, treating task packing as a Knapsack problem to optimally batch jobs based on predicted memory requirements. Additionally, we present a static scheduler that optimizes chromosome processing order to minimize peak memory while preserving throughput. Our proposed methods, evaluated on simulations and real-world genomic pipelines, provide new mechanisms to reduce memory overruns and balance load across threads. We thereby achieve faster end-to-end execution, showcasing the potential to optimize large-scale genomic workflows.

### [Can Asymmetric Tile Buffering Be Beneficial?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16041)
**作者**：Chengyue Wang, Wesley Pang, Xinrui Wu, Gregory Jun, Luis Romero, Endri Taka, Diana Marculescu, Tony Nowatzki, Pranathi Vasireddy, Joseph Melber, Deming Chen, Jason Cong

General matrix multiplication (GEMM) is the computational backbone of modern AI workloads, and its efficiency is critically dependent on effective tiling strategies. Conventional approaches employ symmetric tile buffering, where the buffered tile size of the input $A$ along the dimension $M$ matches the output tile size of $C$.  In this paper, we introduce asymmetric tile buffering (ATB), a simple but powerful technique that decouples the buffered tile dimensions of the input and output operands. We show, for the first time, that ATB is both practical and highly beneficial. To explain this effect, we develop a performance model that incorporates both the benefits of ATB (higher arithmetic intensity) and its overheads (higher kernel switching costs), providing insight into how to select effective ATB tiling factors. As a case study, we apply ATB to AMD's latest XDNA2 AI Engine (AIE), achieving up to a 4.54x speedup, from 4.8 to 24.6 TFLOPS on mixed-precision BFP16--BF16 GEMM, establishing a new performance record for XDNA2 AIE.

### [Algorithms and optimizations for global non-linear hybrid fluid-kinetic finite element stellarator simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16412)
**作者**：Luca Venerando Greco

Predictive modeling of stellarator plasmas is crucial for advancing nuclear fusion energy, yet it faces unique computational difficulties. One of the main challenges is accurately simulating the dynamics of specific particle species that are not well captured by fluid models, which necessitates the use of hybrid fluid-kinetic models. The non-axisymmetric geometry of stellarators fundamentally couples the toroidal Fourier modes, in contrast to what happens in tokamaks, requiring different numerical and computational treatment.  This work presents a novel, globally coupled projection scheme inside the JOREK finite element framework. The approach ensures a self-consistent and physically accurate transfer of kinetic markers to the fluid grid, effectively handling the complex 3D mesh by constructing and solving a unified linear system that encompasses all toroidal harmonics simultaneously. To manage the computational complexity of this coupling, the construction of the system's matrix is significantly accelerated using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The efficient localization of millions of particles is made possible by implementing a 3D R-Tree spatial index, which supports this projection and ensures computational tractability at scale.  On realistic Wendelstein 7-X stellarator geometries, the fidelity of the framework is rigorously shown. In sharp contrast to the uncoupled approaches' poor performance, quantitative convergence tests verify that the coupled scheme attains the theoretically anticipated spectral convergence.  This study offers a crucial capability for the predictive analysis and optimization of next-generation stellarator designs by developing a validated, high-fidelity computational tool.

### [CIMinus: Empowering Sparse DNN Workloads Modeling and Exploration on SRAM-based CIM Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16368)
**作者**：Yingjie Qi, Jianlei Yang, Rubing Yang, Cenlin Duan, Xiaolin He, Ziyan He, Weitao Pan, Weisheng Zhao

Compute-in-memory (CIM) has emerged as a pivotal direction for accelerating workloads in the field of machine learning, such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, the effective exploitation of sparsity in CIM systems presents numerous challenges, due to the inherent limitations in their rigid array structures. Designing sparse DNN dataflows and developing efficient mapping strategies also become more complex when accounting for diverse sparsity patterns and the flexibility of a multi-macro CIM structure. Despite these complexities, there is still an absence of a unified systematic view and modeling approach for diverse sparse DNN workloads in CIM systems. In this paper, we propose CIMinus, a framework dedicated to cost modeling for sparse DNN workloads on CIM architectures. It provides an in-depth energy consumption analysis at the level of individual components and an assessment of the overall workload latency. We validate CIMinus against contemporary CIM architectures and demonstrate its applicability in two use-cases. These cases provide valuable insights into both the impact of sparsity patterns and the effectiveness of mapping strategies, bridging the gap between theoretical design and practical implementation.

### [Unsupervised Graph Neural Network Framework for Balanced Multipatterning in Advanced Electronic Design Automation Layouts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16374)
**作者**：Abdelrahman Helaly, Nourhan Sakr, Kareem Madkour, Ilhami Torunoglu

Multipatterning is an essential decomposition strategy in electronic design automation (EDA) that overcomes lithographic limitations when printing dense circuit layouts. Although heuristic-based backtracking and SAT solvers can address these challenges, they often struggle to simultaneously handle both complex constraints and secondary objectives. In this study, we present a hybrid workflow that casts multipatterning as a variant of a constrained graph coloring problem with the primary objective of minimizing feature violations and a secondary objective of balancing the number of features on each mask. Our pipeline integrates two main components: (1) A GNN-based agent, trained in an unsupervised manner to generate initial color predictions, which are refined by (2) refinement strategies (a GNN-based heuristic and simulated annealing) that together enhance solution quality and balance. Experimental evaluation in both proprietary data sets and publicly available open source layouts demonstrate complete conflict-free decomposition and consistent color balancing. The proposed framework provides a reproducible, data-efficient and deployable baseline for scalable layout decomposition in EDA workflows.

A vertically integrated, end-to-end, research prototype system combines 288 NorthPole neural inference accelerator cards, offline training algorithms, a high-performance runtime stack, and a containerized inference pipeline to deliver a scalable and efficient cloud inference service. The system delivers 115 peta-ops at 4-bit integer precision and 3.7 PB/s of memory bandwidth across 18 2U servers, while consuming only 30 kW of power and weighing 730 kg in a 0.67 m^2 42U rack footprint. The system can run 3 simultaneous instances of the 8-billion-parameter open-source IBM Granite-3.3-8b-instruct model at 2,048 context length with 28 simultaneous users and a per-user inter-token latency of 2.8 ms. The system is scalable, modular, and reconfigurable, supporting various model sizes and context lengths, and is ideal for deploying agentic workflows for enterprise AI applications in existing data center (cloud, on-prem) environments. For example, the system can support 18 instances of a 3-billion-parameter model or a single instance of a 70-billion-parameter model.

Efficient data access in High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems is essential to the performance of intensive computing tasks. Traditional optimizations of the I/O stack aim to improve peak performance but are often workload specific and require deep expertise, making them difficult to generalize or re-use. In shared HPC environments, resource congestion can lead to unpredictable performance, causing slowdowns and timeouts. To address these challenges, we propose a self-adaptive approach based on Control Theory to dynamically regulate client-side I/O rates. Our approach leverages a small set of runtime system load metrics to reduce congestion and enhance performance stability. We implement a controller in a multi-node cluster and evaluate it on a real testbed under a representative workload. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates I/O congestion, reducing total runtime by up to 20% and lowering tail latency, while maintaining stable performance.

### [Hardware-Accelerated Algorithm for Complex Function Roots Density Graph Plotting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02164)
**作者**：Ruibai Tang, Chengbin Quan

Solving and visualizing the potential roots of complex functions is essential in both theoretical and applied domains, yet often computationally intensive. We present a hardware-accelerated algorithm for complex function roots density graph plotting by approximating functions with polynomials and solving their roots using single-shift QR iteration. By leveraging the Hessenberg structure of companion matrices and optimizing QR decomposition with Givens rotations, we design a pipelined FPGA architecture capable of processing a large amount of polynomials with high throughput. Our implementation achieves up to 65x higher energy efficiency than CPU-based approaches, and while it trails modern GPUs in performance. Compared with state-of-the-art QR decomposition solutions, our design specificly optimize QR decomposition for complex-valued Hessenberg matrices up to size 6x6, exhibiting a moderate throughput of 16.5M QR decompositions per second, while prior works have predominantly focused on 4x4 general matrices.

### [Optimizing Communication in Byzantine Agreement Protocols with Slim-HBBFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15957)
**作者**：Nasit S Sony, Xianzhong Ding

Byzantine agreement protocols in asynchronous networks have received renewed interest because they do not rely on network behavior to achieve termination. Conventional asynchronous Byzantine agreement protocols require every party to broadcast its requests (e.g., transactions), and at the end of the protocol, parties agree on one party's request. If parties agree on one party's requests while exchanging every party's request, the protocol becomes expensive. These protocols are used to design an atomic broadcast (ABC) protocol where parties agree on $\langle n-f \rangle$ parties' requests (assuming $n=3f+1$, where $n$ is the total number of parties, and $f$ is the number of Byzantine parties). Although the parties agree on a subset of requests in the ABC protocol, if the requests do not vary (are duplicated), investing in a costly protocol is not justified. We propose Slim-HBBFT, an atomic broadcast protocol that considers requests from a fraction of $n$ parties and improves communication complexity by a factor of $O(n)$. At the core of our design is a prioritized provable-broadcast (P-PB) protocol that generates proof of broadcast only for selected parties. We use the P-PB protocol to design the Slim-HBBFT atomic broadcast protocol. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive security analysis to demonstrate that Slim-HBBFT satisfies the properties of the Asynchronous Common Subset protocol, ensuring robust security and reliability.

### [Optimizing Federated Learning in the Era of LLMs: Message Quantization and Streaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16450)
**作者**：Ziyue Xu, Zhihong Zhang, Holger R. Roth, Chester Chen, Yan Cheng, Andrew Feng

Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution for training machine learning models across distributed data sources while preserving data privacy. However, FL faces critical challenges related to communication overhead and local resource constraints, especially in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs) with billions of parameters. The sheer size of these models exacerbates both memory and communication constraints, making efficient transmission and processing essential for practical deployment. NVIDIA FLARE, an open-source SDK for federated learning, addresses these challenges by introducing advanced communication capabilities. Building upon existing solutions for large object streaming, we enhance FL workflows for LLMs through two key techniques: message quantization and container/file streaming. Quantization reduces message size, while streaming enables efficient memory management, improving scalability and integration with existing workflows. These advancements significantly enhance the robustness and efficiency of FL with LLMs, ensuring better performance in real-world federated learning scenarios.

### [Prioritized-MVBA: A New Approach to Design an Optimal Asynchronous Byzantine Agreement Protocol](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03739)
**作者**：Nasit S Sony, Xianzhong Ding

The multi-valued byzantine agreement protocol (MVBA) in the authenticated setting has been widely used as a core to design atomic broadcast and fault-tolerant state machine replication protocols in asynchronous networks. Originating from the seminal work of Cachin et al. \cite{CACHIN01}, subsequent research endeavors have sought to optimize protocol efficiency in terms of communication complexity. Notable advancements following Cachin's contributions include: i) VABA \cite{BYZ17}, requiring multiple protocol instances to achieve agreement on a party's request, and ii) Dumbo-MVBA \cite{LU20}, employing a cryptographic asynchronous dispersal and recovery methods to manage communication complexity alongside additional computational and communication rounds overheads.  Our objective is to devise an MVBA protocol that achieves agreement in each instance without extra computation and communication rounds while maintaining the optimal metrics. Central to our design approach is the introduction of the committee in the classic MVBA protocol, wherein a randomly selected subset of ($f+1$, where $n=3f+1$) parties get selected and simultaneously broadcast their requests (transactions) to gather verifiable proofs. Successive distributions of these proofs afford us the necessary properties to employ the asynchronous binary Byzantine agreement (ABBA) protocol for reaching an agreement on a selected party's requests. By integrating the committee and ABBA protocols, we devise the optimal MVBA protocol, termed pMVBA (Prioritized-MVBA). This protocol exhibits resilience to tolerate up to $\lfloor \frac{n}{3}\rfloor$ Byzantine failures, with an expected runtime of $O(1)$, optimal message complexity of $O(n^2)$, and optimal communication complexity $O((l+\lambda)n^2)$ .

### [MonadBFT: Fast, Responsive, Fork-Resistant Streamlined Consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20692)
**作者**：Mohammad Mussadiq Jalalzai, Kushal Babel, Jovan Komatovic, Tobias Klenze, Sourav Das, Fatima Elsheimy, Mike Setrin, John Bergschneider, Babak Gilkalaye

This paper introduces MonadBFT, a novel Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol that advances both performance and robustness. MonadBFT is implemented as the consensus protocol in the Monad blockchain. As a HotStuff-family protocol, MonadBFT has linear message complexity in the common case and is optimistically responsive, operating as quickly as the network allows. A central feature of MonadBFT is its tail-forking resistance. In pipelined BFT protocols, when a leader goes offline, the previous proposal is abandoned. Malicious leaders can exploit this tail-forking behavior as a form of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) attack by deliberately discarding their predecessor's block, depriving that proposer of rewards and enabling transaction reordering, censorship or theft. MonadBFT prevents such tail-forking attacks, preserving both fairness and integrity in transaction execution. Another related feature of MonadBFT is its notion of speculative finality, which enables parties to execute ordered transactions after a single round (i.e., a single view), with reverts occurring only in the rare case of provable leader equivocation. This mechanism reduces user-perceived latency. Additionally, we introduce the leader fault isolation property, which ensures that the protocol can quickly recover from a failure. To our knowledge, no prior pipelined, leader-based BFT consensus protocol combines all of these properties in a single design.

### [Fast LLM Post-training via Decoupled and Best-of-N Speculation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16193)
**作者**：Rongxin Cheng, Kai Zhou, Xingda Wei, Siyuan Liu, Mingcong Han, Mingjing Ai, Yeju Zhou, Baoquan Zhong, Wencong Xiao, Xin Liu, Rong Chen, Haibo Chen

Rollout dominates the training time in large language model (LLM) post-training, where the trained model is used to generate tokens given a batch of prompts. SpecActor achieves fast rollout with speculative decoding that deploys a fast path (e.g., a smaller model) to accelerate the unparallelizable generation, while the correctness is guaranteed by fast parallel verification of the outputs with the original model. SpecActor addresses two foundational challenges in speculative rollout by (1) a \emph{dynamic decoupled speculation} execution method that maximizes the GPU computational efficiency to realize speedup for large-batch execution -- a configuration common in training but unfriendly to speculative execution and (2) a \emph{dynamic Best-of-N speculation} method that selects and combines different drafting methods according to the rollout progress. It substantially improves the speculation accuracy even when the best drafting method is unknown a priori, meanwhile without requiring adding extra computation resources. {\sys} is {1.3--1.7}\,$\times$ faster than common post-training baselines, and is {1.3--1.5}\,$\times$ faster compared to naively adopting speculative decoding for rollout.

### [Distributed MIS Algorithms for Rational Agents using Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16533)
**作者**：Nithin Salevemula, Shreyas Pai

We study the problem of computing a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) in distributed networks where each node is a rational agent whose payoff depends on whether it joins the MIS. Classical distributed algorithms assume that nodes follow the prescribed protocol, but this assumption fails when nodes are strategic and may deviate if doing so increases their expected utility.  Standard MIS algorithms rely on honest randomness or unique identifiers to break symmetry. In rational settings, however, agents may manipulate randomness, and relying solely on identifiers can create unfairness, giving some nodes zero probability of joining the MIS and thus no incentive to participate. To address these issues, we propose two algorithms based on a utility model in which agents seek locally correct solutions while also having preferences over which solution is chosen. Randomness in our algorithms is generated through pairwise interactions between neighboring nodes, viewed as simple games in which no single node can unilaterally affect the outcome. This allows symmetry breaking while remaining compatible with rational behavior.  For both algorithms, we prove that at every stage of the execution, given any history, no agent can increase its expected utility through a unilateral deviation, assuming others follow the algorithm. This gives a stronger guarantee than Trembling-Hand Perfect Equilibrium. When all nodes follow the protocol, every node has a positive probability of joining the MIS, and the final output is a correct MIS. Under mild additional assumptions, both algorithms terminate in $O(\log n)$ rounds with high probability.

### [Secure Autonomous Agent Payments: Verifying Authenticity and Intent in a Trustless Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15712)
**作者**：Vivek Acharya

Artificial intelligence (AI) agents are increasingly capable of initiating financial transactions on behalf of users or other agents. This evolution introduces a fundamental challenge: verifying both the authenticity of an autonomous agent and the true intent behind its transactions in a decentralized, trustless environment. Traditional payment systems assume human authorization, but autonomous, agent-led payments remove that safeguard. This paper presents a blockchain-based framework that cryptographically authenticates and verifies the intent of every AI-initiated transaction. The proposed system leverages decentralized identity (DID) standards and verifiable credentials to establish agent identities, on-chain intent proofs to record user authorization, and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to preserve privacy while ensuring policy compliance. Additionally, secure execution environments (TEE-based attestations) guarantee the integrity of agent reasoning and execution. The hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture provides an immutable audit trail linking user intent to payment outcome. Through qualitative analysis, the framework demonstrates strong resistance to impersonation, unauthorized transactions, and misalignment of intent. This work lays the foundation for secure, auditable, and intent-aware autonomous economic agents, enabling a future of verifiable trust and accountability in AI-driven financial ecosystems.

### [Digital Agriculture Sandbox for Collaborative Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15990)
**作者**：Osama Zafar, Rosemarie Santa Gonz\'alez, Alfonso Morales, Erman Ayday

Digital agriculture is transforming the way we grow food by utilizing technology to make farming more efficient, sustainable, and productive. This modern approach to agriculture generates a wealth of valuable data that could help address global food challenges, but farmers are hesitant to share it due to privacy concerns. This limits the extent to which researchers can learn from this data to inform improvements in farming. This paper presents the Digital Agriculture Sandbox, a secure online platform that solves this problem. The platform enables farmers (with limited technical resources) and researchers to collaborate on analyzing farm data without exposing private information. We employ specialized techniques such as federated learning, differential privacy, and data analysis methods to safeguard the data while maintaining its utility for research purposes. The system enables farmers to identify similar farmers in a simplified manner without needing extensive technical knowledge or access to computational resources. Similarly, it enables researchers to learn from the data and build helpful tools without the sensitive information ever leaving the farmer's system. This creates a safe space where farmers feel comfortable sharing data, allowing researchers to make important discoveries. Our platform helps bridge the gap between maintaining farm data privacy and utilizing that data to address critical food and farming challenges worldwide.

### [Pipelined Dense Symmetric Eigenvalue Decomposition on Multi-GPU Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16174)
**作者**：Hansheng Wang, Ruiyi Zhan, Dajun Huang, Xingchen Liu, Qiao Li, Hancong Duan, Dingwen Tao, Guangming Tan, Shaoshuai Zhang

Large symmetric eigenvalue problems are commonly observed in many disciplines such as Chemistry and Physics, and several libraries including cuSOLVERMp, MAGMA and ELPA support computing large eigenvalue decomposition on multi-GPU or multi-CPU-GPU hybrid architectures. However, these libraries do not provide satisfied performance that all of the libraries only utilize around 1.5\% of the peak multi-GPU performance. In this paper, we propose a pipelined two-stage eigenvalue decomposition algorithm instead of conventional subsequent algorithm with substantial optimizations. On an 8$\times$A100 platform, our implementation surpasses state-of-the-art cuSOLVERMp and MAGMA baselines, delivering mean speedups of 5.74$\times$ and 6.59$\times$, with better strong and weak scalability.

### [A Fast Relax-and-Round Approach to Unit Commitment for Data Center Own Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16420)
**作者**：Shaked Regev, Eve Tsybina, Slaven Peles

The rapid growth of data centers increasingly requires data center operators to "bring own generation" to complement the available utility power plants to supply all or part of data center load. This practice sharply increases the number of generators on the bulk power system and shifts operational focus toward fuel costs rather than traditional startup and runtime constraints. Conventional mixed-integer unit commitment formulations are not well suited for systems with thousands of flexible, fast-cycling units. We propose a unit commitment formulation that relaxes binary commitment decisions by allowing generators to be fractionally on, enabling the use of algorithms for continuous solvers. We then use a rounding approach to get a feasible unit commitment. For a 276-unit system, solution time decreases from 10 hours to less than a second, with minor accuracy degradation. Our approach scales with no issues to tens of thousands of generators, which allows solving problems on the scale of the major North America interconnections. The bulk of computation is parallel and GPU compatible, enabling further acceleration in future work.

### [Taming the Long-Tail: Efficient Reasoning RL Training with Adaptive Drafter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16665)
**作者**：Qinghao Hu, Shang Yang, Junxian Guo, Xiaozhe Yao, Yujun Lin, Yuxian Gu, Han Cai, Chuang Gan, Ana Klimovic, Song Han

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning capabilities marks a significant milestone, unlocking new frontiers in complex problem-solving. However, training these reasoning models, typically using Reinforcement Learning (RL), encounters critical efficiency bottlenecks: response generation during RL training exhibits a persistent long-tail distribution, where a few very long responses dominate execution time, wasting resources and inflating costs. To address this, we propose TLT, a system that accelerates reasoning RL training losslessly by integrating adaptive speculative decoding. Applying speculative decoding in RL is challenging due to the dynamic workloads, evolving target model, and draft model training overhead. TLT overcomes these obstacles with two synergistic components: (1) Adaptive Drafter, a lightweight draft model trained continuously on idle GPUs during long-tail generation to maintain alignment with the target model at no extra cost; and (2) Adaptive Rollout Engine, which maintains a memory-efficient pool of pre-captured CUDAGraphs and adaptively select suitable SD strategies for each input batch. Evaluations demonstrate that TLT achieves over 1.7x end-to-end RL training speedup over state-of-the-art systems, preserves the model accuracy, and yields a high-quality draft model as a free byproduct suitable for efficient deployment. Code is released at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/fastrl.

### [Renaming in distributed certification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15404)
**作者**：Nicolas Bousquet, Louis Esperet, Laurent Feuilloley, S\'ebastien Zeitoun

Local certification is the area of distributed network computing asking the following question: How to certify to the nodes of a network that a global property holds, if they are limited to a local verification?  In this area, it is often essential to have identifiers, that is, unique integers assigned to the nodes. In this short paper, we show how to reduce the range of the identifiers, in three different settings. More precisely, we show how to rename identifiers in the classical local certification setting, when we can (resp.\ cannot) choose the new identifiers, and we show how a global certificate can help to encode very compactly a new identifier assignment that is not injective in general, but still useful in applications.  We conclude with a number of applications of these results: For every $\ell$, there are local certification schemes for the properties of having clique number at most $\ell$, having diameter at most $\ell$, and having independence number at most~2, with certificates of size $O(n)$. We also show that there is a global certification scheme for bipartiteness with a certificate of size $O(n)$. All these results are optimal.
