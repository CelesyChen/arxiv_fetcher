### [Enabling Heterogeneous Performance Analysis for Scientific Workloads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13928)
**作者**：Maksymilian Graczyk, Vincent Desbiolles, Stefan Roiser, Andrea Guerrieri

Heterogeneous computing integrates diverse processing elements, such as CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs, within a single system, aiming to leverage the strengths of each architecture to optimize performance and energy consumption. In this context, efficient performance analysis plays a critical role in determining the most suitable platform for dispatching tasks, ensuring that workloads are allocated to the processing units where they can execute most effectively. Adaptyst is a novel ongoing effort at CERN, with the aim to develop an open-source, architecture-agnostic performance analysis for scientific workloads. This study explores the performance and implementation complexity of two built-in eBPF-based methods such as Uprobes and USDT, with the aim of outlining a roadmap for future integration into Adaptyst and advancing toward heterogeneous performance analysis capabilities.

### [Library Liberation: Competitive Performance Matmul Through Compiler-composed Nanokernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13764)
**作者**：Arun Thangamani, Md Asghar Ahmad Shahid, Adam Siemieniuk, Rolf Morel, Renato Golin, Alexander Heinecke

The rapidly evolving landscape of AI and machine learning workloads has widened the gap between high-level domain operations and efficient hardware utilization. Achieving near-peak performance still demands deep hardware expertise-experts either handcraft target-specific kernels (e.g., DeepSeek) or rely on specialized libraries (e.g., CUTLASS)-both of which add complexity and limit scalability for most ML practitioners.  This paper introduces a compilation scheme that automatically generates scalable, high-performance microkernels by leveraging the MLIR dialects to bridge domain-level operations and processor capabilities. Our approach removes dependence on low-level libraries by enabling the compiler to auto-generate near-optimal code directly. At its core is a mechanism for composing nanokernels from low-level IR constructs with near-optimal register utilization, forming efficient microkernels tailored to each target. We implement this technique in an MLIR-based compiler supporting both vector and tile based CPU instructions. Experiments show that the generated nanokernels are of production-quality, and competitive with state-of-the-art microkernel libraries.

### [PIM or CXL-PIM? Understanding Architectural Trade-offs Through Large-Scale Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14400)
**作者**：I-Ting Lee, Bao-Kai Wang, Liang-Chi Chen, Wen Sheng Lim, Da-Wei Chang, Yu-Ming Chang, Chieng-Chung Ho

Processing-in-memory (PIM) reduces data movement by executing near memory, but our large-scale characterization on real PIM hardware shows that end-to-end performance is often limited by disjoint host and device address spaces that force explicit staging transfers. In contrast, CXL-PIM provides a unified address space and cache-coherent access at the cost of higher access latency. These opposing interface models create workload-dependent tradeoffs that are not captured by small-scale studies. This work presents a side-by-side, large-scale comparison of PIM and CXL-PIM using measurements from real PIM hardware and trace-driven CXL modeling. We identify when unified-address access amortizes link latency enough to overcome transfer bottlenecks, and when tightly coupled PIM remains preferable. Our results reveal phase- and dataset-size regimes in which the relative ranking between the two architectures reverses, offering practical guidance for future near-memory system design.

### [Evaluating the Impact of Packet Scheduling and Congestion Control Algorithms on MPTCP Performance over Heterogeneous Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14550)
**作者**：Dimitrios Dimopoulos, Apostolis K. Salkintzis, Dimitris Tsolkas, Nikos Passas, Lazaros Merakos

Modern mobile and stationary devices are equipped with multiple network interfaces aiming to provide wireless and wireline connectivity either in a local LAN or the Internet. Multipath TCP (MPTCP) protocol has been developed on top of legacy TCP to allow the simultaneous use of multiple network paths in the communication route between two end-systems. Although the combination of multiple paths is beneficial in case of links with similar network characteristics, MPTCP performance is challenged as heterogeneity among the used paths increases. This work provides an overview of the MPTCP protocol operation, analyzes the state-of-art packet scheduling and congestion control algorithms available in literature, and examines the impact of the various algorithm combinations on MPTCP performance, by conducting an extensive experimental evaluation under diverse path-heterogeneity conditions.

### [KWT-Tiny: RISC-V Accelerated, Embedded Keyword Spotting Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16026)
**作者**：Aness Al-Qawlaq, Ajay Kumar M, Deepu John

This paper explores the adaptation of Transformerbased models for edge devices through the quantisation and hardware acceleration of the ARM Keyword Transformer (KWT) model on a RISC-V platform. The model was targeted to run on 64kB RAM in bare-metal C using a custom-developed edge AI library. KWT-1 was retrained to be 369 times smaller, with only a 10% loss in accuracy through reducing output classes from 35 to 2. The retraining and quantisation reduced model size from 2.42 MB to 1.65 kB. The integration of custom RISC-V instructions that accelerated GELU and SoftMax operations enabled a 5x speedup and thus ~5x power reduction in inference, with inference clock cycle counts decreasing from 26 million to 5.5 million clock cycles while incurring a small area overhead of approximately 29%. The results demonstrate a viable method for porting and accelerating Transformer-based models in low-power IoT devices.

### [NL-DPE: An Analog In-memory Non-Linear Dot Product Engine for Efficient CNN and LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13950)
**作者**：Lei Zhao, Luca Buonanno, Archit Gajjar, John Moon, Aishwarya Natarajan, Sergey Serebryakov, Ron M. Roth, Xia Sheng, Youtao Zhang, Paolo Faraboschi, Jim Ignowski, Giacomo Pedretti

Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) based in-memory computing (IMC) accelerators offer significant performance and energy advantages for deep neural networks (DNNs), but face three major limitations: (1) they support only \textit{static} dot-product operations and cannot accelerate arbitrary non-linear functions or data-dependent multiplications essential to modern LLMs; (2) they demand large, power-hungry analog-to-digital converter (ADC) circuits; and (3) mapping model weights to device conductance introduces errors from cell nonidealities. These challenges hinder scalable and accurate IMC acceleration as models grow.  We propose NL-DPE, a Non-Linear Dot Product Engine that overcomes these barriers. NL-DPE augments crosspoint arrays with RRAM-based Analog Content Addressable Memory (ACAM) to execute arbitrary non-linear functions and data-dependent matrix multiplications in the analog domain by transforming them into decision trees, fully eliminating ADCs. To address device noise, NL-DPE uses software-based Noise Aware Fine-tuning (NAF), requiring no in-device calibration. Experiments show that NL-DPE delivers 28X energy efficiency and 249X speedup over a GPU baseline, and 22X energy efficiency and 245X speedup over existing IMC accelerators, while maintaining high accuracy.

### [A Bit Level Weight Reordering Strategy Based on Column Similarity to Explore Weight Sparsity in RRAM-based NN Accelerator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14202)
**作者**：Weiping Yang, Shilin Zhou, Hui Xu, Yujiao Nie, Qimin Zhou, Zhiwei Li, Changlin Chen

Compute-in-Memory (CIM) and weight sparsity are two effective techniques to reduce data movement during Neural Network (NN) inference. However, they can hardly be employed in the same accelerator simultaneously because CIM requires structural compute patterns which are disrupted in sparse NNs. In this paper, we partially solve this issue by proposing a bit level weight reordering strategy which can realize compact mapping of sparse NN weight matrices onto Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) based NN Accelerators (RRAM-Acc). In specific, when weights are mapped to RRAM crossbars in a binary complement manner, we can observe that, which can also be mathematically proven, bit-level sparsity and similarity commonly exist in the crossbars. The bit reordering method treats bit sparsity as a special case of bit similarity, reserve only one column in a pair of columns that have identical bit values, and then map the compressed weight matrices into Operation Units (OU). The performance of our design is evaluated with typical NNs. Simulation results show a 61.24% average performance improvement and 1.51x-2.52x energy savings under different sparsity ratios, with only slight overhead compared to the state-of-the-art design.

### [Bare-Metal RISC-V + NVDLA SoC for Efficient Deep Learning Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16095)
**作者**：Vineet Kumar (School of Electrical,Electronic Engineering, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland, Department of Electronic,Electrical Engineering, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland), Ajay Kumar M (School of Electrical,Electronic Engineering, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland, Department of Electronic,Electrical Engineering, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland), Yike Li (School of Electrical,Electronic Engineering, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland, Department of Electronic,Electrical Engineering, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland), Shreejith Shanker (School of Electrical,Electronic Engineering, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland, Department of Electronic,Electrical Engineering, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland), Deepu John (School of Electrical,Electronic Engineering, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland, Department of Electronic,Electrical Engineering, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland)

This paper presents a novel System-on-Chip (SoC) architecture for accelerating complex deep learning models for edge computing applications through a combination of hardware and software optimisations. The hardware architecture tightly couples the open-source NVIDIA Deep Learning Accelerator (NVDLA) to a 32-bit, 4-stage pipelined RISC-V core from Codasip called uRISC_V. To offload the model acceleration in software, our toolflow generates bare-metal application code (in assembly), overcoming complex OS overheads of previous works that have explored similar architectures. This tightly coupled architecture and bare-metal flow leads to improvements in execution speed and storage efficiency, making it suitable for edge computing solutions. We evaluate the architecture on AMD's ZCU102 FPGA board using NVDLA-small configuration and test the flow using LeNet-5, ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 models. Our results show that these models can perform inference in 4.8 ms, 16.2 ms and 1.1 s respectively, at a system clock frequency of 100 MHz.

### [TT-Edge: A Hardware-Software Co-Design for Energy-Efficient Tensor-Train Decomposition on Edge AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13738)
**作者**：Hyunseok Kwak, Kyeongwon Lee, Kyeongpil Min, Chaebin Jung, Woojoo Lee

The growing demands of distributed learning on resource constrained edge devices underscore the importance of efficient on device model compression. Tensor Train Decomposition (TTD) offers high compression ratios with minimal accuracy loss, yet repeated singular value decompositions (SVDs) and matrix multiplications can impose significant latency and energy costs on low power processors. In this work, we present TT-Edge, a hardware software co designed framework aimed at overcoming these challenges. By splitting SVD into two phases--bidiagonalization and diagonalization--TT-Edge offloads the most compute intensive tasks to a specialized TTD Engine. This engine integrates tightly with an existing GEMM accelerator, thereby curtailing the frequent matrix vector transfers that often undermine system performance and energy efficiency. Implemented on a RISC-V-based edge AI processor, TT-Edge achieves a 1.7x speedup compared to a GEMM only baseline when compressing a ResNet 32 model via TTD, while reducing overall energy usage by 40.2 percent. These gains come with only a 4 percent increase in total power and minimal hardware overhead, enabled by a lightweight design that reuses GEMM resources and employs a shared floating point unit. Our experimental results on both FPGA prototypes and post-synthesis power analysis at 45 nm demonstrate that TT-Edge effectively addresses the latency and energy bottlenecks of TTD based compression in edge environments.

### [Inside VOLT: Designing an Open-Source GPU Compiler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13751)
**作者**：Shinnung Jeong, Chihyo Ahn, Huanzhi Pu, Jisheng Zhao, Hyesoon Kim, Blaise Tine

Recent efforts in open-source GPU research are opening new avenues in a domain that has long been tightly coupled with a few commercial vendors. Emerging open GPU architectures define SIMT functionality through their own ISAs, but executing existing GPU programs and optimizing performance on these ISAs relies on a compiler framework that is technically complex and often undercounted in open hardware development costs.  To address this challenge, the Vortex-Optimized Lightweight Toolchain (VOLT) has been proposed. This paper presents its design principles, overall structure, and the key compiler transformations required to support SIMT execution on Vortex. VOLT enables SIMT code generation and optimization across multiple levels of abstraction through a hierarchical design that accommodates diverse front-end languages and open GPU hardware. To ensure extensibility as GPU architectures evolve, VOLT centralizes fundamental SIMT-related analyses and optimizations in the middle-end, allowing them to be reused across front-ends and easily adapted to emerging open-GPU variants. Through two case studies on ISA extensions and host-runtime API, this paper also demonstrates how VOLT can support extensions

### [Graph Neural Networks Based Analog Circuit Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10240)
**作者**：Guanyuan Pan, Tiansheng Zhou, Jianxiang Zhao, Zhi Li, Yugui Lin, Bingtao Ma, Yaqi Wang, Pietro Li\`o, Shuai Wang

Circuit link prediction, which identifies missing component connections from incomplete netlists, is crucial in analog circuit design automation. However, existing methods face three main challenges: 1) Insufficient use of topological patterns in circuit graphs reduces prediction accuracy; 2) Data scarcity due to the complexity of annotations hinders model generalization; 3) Limited adaptability to various netlist formats restricts model flexibility. We propose Graph Neural Networks Based Analog Circuit Link Prediction (GNN-ACLP), a graph neural networks (GNNs) based method featuring three innovations to tackle these challenges. First, we introduce the SEAL (learning from Subgraphs, Embeddings, and Attributes for Link prediction) framework and achieve port-level accuracy in circuit link prediction. Second, we propose Netlist Babel Fish, a netlist format conversion tool that leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with a large language model (LLM) to enhance the compatibility of netlist formats. Finally, we build a comprehensive dataset, SpiceNetlist, comprising 775 annotated circuits of 7 different types across 10 component classes. Experiments demonstrate accuracy improvements of 16.08% on SpiceNetlist, 11.38% on Image2Net, and 16.01% on Masala-CHAI compared to the baseline in intra-dataset evaluation, while maintaining accuracy from 92.05% to 99.07% in cross-dataset evaluation, demonstrating robust feature transfer capabilities. However, its linear computational complexity makes processing large-scale netlists challenging and requires future addressing.

### [Boosting performance: Gradient Clock Synchronisation with two-way measured links](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13727)
**作者**：Sophie Wenning

This master thesis extends the formal model of the GCS algorithm as presented by (Fan and Lynch 2004, 325), (Lenzen, Locher and Wattenhofer 2008, 510) and (F\"ugger et al. 2023) to operate under implementation-near assumptions by replacing the one-way measurement paradigm assumed in prior work by the two-way measurement paradigm. With this change of paradigm, we remove many restrictions previously enforced to allow provable performance. Most notability, while maintaining the core behaviour of GCS, we: 1. Lift the requirement for unitary link lengths and thereby create a realistic model for flexible deployment of implementations of GCS in practice. 2. Provide a formal model of frequency sources assumed in prior work. 3. Perform a fine grained distinction between the different components of the algorithm's estimation error and globally reduce its impact by multiple orders of magnitude. 4. Significantly reduce the contribution of the uncertainty to the algorithm's estimation error to be in the range of 10\% to 0,1\% of the delay per link instead of being in the oder of the delay per link as in prior work and show matching upper bounds on the local and global skew of GCS.

### [Gaia: Hybrid Hardware Acceleration for Serverless AI in the 3D Compute Continuum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13728)
**作者**：Maximilian Reisecker, Cynthia Marcelino, Thomas Pusztai, Stefan Nastic

Serverless computing offers elastic scaling and pay-per-use execution, making it well-suited for AI workloads. As these workloads run in heterogeneous environments such as the Edge-Cloud-Space 3D Continuum, they often require intensive parallel computation, which GPUs can perform far more efficiently than CPUs. However, current platforms struggle to manage hardware acceleration effectively, as static user-device assignments fail to ensure SLO compliance under varying loads or placements, and one-time dynamic selections often lead to suboptimal or cost-inefficient configurations. To address these issues, we present Gaia, a GPU-as-a-service model and architecture that makes hardware acceleration a platform concern. Gaia combines (i) a lightweight Execution Mode Identifier that inspects function code at deploy time to emit one of four execution modes, and a Dynamic Function Runtime that continuously reevaluates user-defined SLOs to promote or demote between CPU- and GPU backends. Our evaluation shows that it seamlessly selects the best hardware acceleration for the workload, reducing end-to-end latency by up to 95%. These results indicate that Gaia enables SLO-aware, cost-efficient acceleration for serverless AI across heterogeneous environments.

### [Guaranteed DGEMM Accuracy While Using Reduced Precision Tensor Cores Through Extensions of the Ozaki Scheme](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13778)
**作者**：Angelika Schwarz, Anton Anders, Cole Brower, Harun Bayraktar, John Gunnels, Kate Clark, RuQing G. Xu, Samuel Rodriguez, Sebastien Cayrols, Pawe{\l} Tabaszewski, Victor Podlozhnyuk

The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has made low-precision formats such as FP16, FP8, and, most recently, block-scaled FP4 the primary focus of modern GPUs, where Tensor Cores now deliver orders-of-magnitude higher throughput than traditional FP64 pipelines. This hardware shift has sparked a new line of algorithm research: using low-precision units to emulate double-precision accuracy through schemes such as Ozaki decompositions. We advance this direction with Automatic Dynamic Precision (ADP), a fully GPU-resident framework that makes emulated FP64 matrix multiplication both efficient and reliable. At its core is the Exponent Span Capacity (ESC), a hardware-agnostic estimator that conservatively determines the decomposition parameter (also known as slices) required to achieve FP64-level accuracy. Built on ESC, ADP integrates exception handling, run time heuristics, and seamless fallback to native FP64, ensuring correctness without host-device synchronization or user intervention. Additionally, we further improve Ozaki-style decompositions with an unsigned integer slicing scheme, which increases representational efficiency and reduces computational waste. Validated against recently proposed BLAS grading tests, ADP consistently preserves FP64 fidelity on challenging inputs while incurring less than 10% run time overhead. In a 55-bit mantissa setting, our approach achieves up to 2.3x and 13.2x speedups over native FP64 GEMM on NVIDIA Blackwell GB200 and the RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell Server Edition, respectively. Our results demonstrate that low-precision accelerators can serve as a practical, production-ready foundation for high-fidelity and high-performance scientific computing workloads.

### [Do MPI Derived Datatypes Actually Help? A Single-Node Cross-Implementation Study on Shared-Memory Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13804)
**作者**：Temitayo Adefemi

MPI's derived datatypes (DDTs) promise easier, copy-free communication of non-contiguous data, yet their practical performance remains debated and is often reported only for a single MPI stack. We present a cross-implementation assessment using three 2D applications: a Jacobi CFD solver, Conway's Game of Life, and a lattice-based image reconstruction. Each application is written in two ways: (i) a BASIC version with manual packing and unpacking of non-contiguous regions and (ii) a DDT version using MPI_Type_vector and MPI_Type_create_subarray with correct true extent via MPI_Type_create_resized. For API parity, we benchmark identical communication semantics: non-blocking point-to-point (Irecv/Isend + Waitall), neighborhood collectives (MPI_Neighbor_alltoallw), and MPI-4 persistent operations (*_init). We run strong and weak scaling on 1-4 ranks, validate bitwise-identical halos, and evaluate four widely used MPI implementations: MPICH, Open MPI, Intel MPI, and MVAPICH2 on a single ARCHER2 node. Results are mixed. DDTs can be fastest, for example for the image reconstruction code on Intel MPI and MPICH, but can also be among the slowest on other stacks, such as Open MPI and MVAPICH2 for the same code. For the CFD solver, BASIC variants generally outperform DDTs across semantics, whereas for Game of Life the ranking flips depending on the MPI library. We also observe stack-specific anomalies, for example MPICH slowdowns with DDT neighborhood and persistent modes. Overall, no strategy dominates across programs, semantics, and MPI stacks; performance portability for DDTs is not guaranteed. We therefore recommend profiling both DDT-based and manual-packing designs under the intended MPI implementation and communication mode. Our study is limited to a single node and does not analyze memory overhead; multi-node and GPU-aware paths are left for future work.

### [FailSafe: High-performance Resilient Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14116)
**作者**：Ziyi Xu, Zhiqiang Xie, Swapnil Gandhi, Christos Kozyrakis

Tensor parallelism (TP) enables large language models (LLMs) to scale inference efficiently across multiple GPUs, but its tight coupling makes systems fragile: a single GPU failure can halt execution, trigger costly KVCache recomputation, and introduce long-term compute and memory imbalance. We present FailSafe, a fault-tolerant TP serving system that sustains high performance under irregular GPU availability. FailSafe introduces three techniques to balance computation and memory across GPUs: (1) Cyclic KVCache Placement for uniform memory utilization, (2) Hybrid Attention combining tensor- and data-parallel attention to eliminate stragglers, and (3) Fine-Grained Load-Aware Routing to dynamically balance requests. It further employs proactive KVCache backup and on-demand weight recovery to avoid expensive recomputation and redundant data transfers. We implement these techniques in a lightweight serving engine compatible with existing LLM infrastructures. Evaluated on an 8xH100 DGX system with real-world fault traces and representative workloads, FailSafe achieves up to 2x higher throughput and two orders of magnitude lower recovery latency compared to standard fault handling approaches. Even with up to three GPU failures, FailSafe sustains high throughput and balanced utilization, demonstrating robust and efficient LLM serving under dynamic and unreliable hardware conditions.

### [Hyperion: Hierarchical Scheduling for Parallel LLM Acceleration in Multi-tier Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14450)
**作者**：Mulei Ma, Minrui Xu, Zihan Chen, Yang Yang, Tony Q. S. Quek

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly executed across edge, fog, and cloud tiers where limited GPU memory, heterogeneous compute, and variable inter-tier bandwidth jointly constrain deployment and motivate model partitioning and request scheduling. In this setting, achieving low end-to-end latency is governed not only by where a model is deployed (inter-tier model partitioning) but also by how incoming requests are scheduled (intra-tier task scheduling) across heterogeneous nodes. These two problems are tightly coupled, as a suboptimal scheduler can negate the benefits of a good partition, and vice versa. In this paper, we propose Hyperion, a hierarchical two-stage framework that jointly optimizes partitioning and scheduling to minimize end-to-end latency for pipelined LLM inference in multi-tier networks, balancing compute and memory across tiers while introducing negligible runtime overhead and requiring no model retraining. Motivated by the observation that partition choices evolve on slower timescales than request arrivals, Stage 1 performs offline, inter-tier partitioning via a Binary Search with Dynamic Programming (BSDP) procedure to produce balanced stage times under tier capacity and memory constraints; to adapt to time-varying load, Stage 2 performs online, intra-tier scheduling with a lightweight Adaptive Real-time Task Scheduling (ARTS) algorithm that maps each request to the best available node using real-time estimates of queue length and effective capacity. Experimental results on multi-tier inference tasks demonstrate that Hyperion significantly reduces end-to-end latency by up to 52.1\% and 31.2\%, with the Phi-3-medium model, compared to the GPipe and HEFT baselines, respectively. Furthermore, Hyperion shows superior scalability in long-sequence generation, maintaining a 44.5\% lower latency than GPipe and achieving higher GPU utilization.

### [Hapax Locks : Value-Based Mutual Exclusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14608)
**作者**：Dave Dice, Alex Kogan

We present Hapax Locks, a novel locking algorithm that is simple, enjoys constant-time arrival and unlock paths, provides FIFO admission order, and which is also space efficient and generates relatively little coherence traffic under contention in the common case. Hapax Locks offer performance (both latency and scalability) that is comparable with the best state of the art locks, while at the same time Hapax Locks impose fewer constraints and dependencies on the ambient runtime environment, making them particularly easy to integrate or retrofit into existing systems or under existing application programming interfaces Of particular note, no pointers shift or escape ownership between threads in our algorithm.

### [What happens when nanochat meets DiLoCo?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13761)
**作者**：Alexander Acker, Soeren Becker, Sasho Nedelkoski, Dominik Scheinert, Odej Kao, Philipp Wiesner

Although LLM training is typically centralized with high-bandwidth interconnects and large compute budgets, emerging methods target communication-constrained training in distributed environments. The model trade-offs introduced by this shift remain underexplored, and our goal is to study them.  We use the open-source nanochat project, a compact 8K-line full-stack ChatGPT-like implementation containing tokenization, pretraining, fine-tuning, and serving, as a controlled baseline. We implement the DiLoCo algorithm as a lightweight wrapper over nanochat's training loop, performing multiple local steps per worker before synchronization with an outer optimizer, effectively reducing communication by orders of magnitude. This inner-outer training is compared against a standard data-parallel (DDP) setup. Because nanochat is small and inspectable, it enables controlled pipeline adaptations and allows direct comparison with the conventional centralized baseline.  DiLoCo achieves stable convergence and competitive loss in pretraining but yields worse MMLU, GSM8K, and HumanEval scores after mid-training and SFT. We discover that using DiLoCo-pretrained weights and running mid- and post-training with DDP fails to recover performance, revealing irreversible representation drift from asynchronous updates that impairs downstream alignment. We provide this implementation as an official fork of nanochat on GitHub.

### [Semantic Multiplexing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13779)
**作者**：Mohammad Abdi, Francesca Meneghello, Francesco Restuccia

Mobile devices increasingly require the parallel execution of several computing tasks offloaded at the wireless edge. Existing communication systems only support parallel transmissions at the bit level, which fundamentally limits the number of tasks that can be concurrently processed. To address this bottleneck, this paper introduces the new concept of Semantic Multiplexing. Our approach shifts stream multiplexing from bits to tasks by merging multiple task-related compressed representations into a single semantic representation. As such, Semantic Multiplexing can multiplex more tasks than the number of physical channels without adding antennas or widening bandwidth by extending the effective degrees of freedom at the semantic layer, without contradicting Shannon capacity rules. We have prototyped Semantic Multiplexing on an experimental testbed with Jetson Orin Nano and millimeter-wave software-defined radios and tested its performance on image classification and sentiment analysis while comparing to several existing baselines in semantic communications. Our experiments demonstrate that Semantic Multiplexing allows jointly processing multiple tasks at the semantic level while maintaining sufficient task accuracy. For example, image classification accuracy drops by less than 4% when increasing from 2 to 8 the number of tasks multiplexed over a 4$\times$4 channel. Semantic Multiplexing reduces latency, energy consumption, and communication load respectively by up to 8$\times$, 25$\times$, and 54$\times$ compared to the baselines while keeping comparable performance. We pledge to publicly share the complete software codebase and the collected datasets for reproducibility.

### [ParallelKittens: Systematic and Practical Simplification of Multi-GPU AI Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13940)
**作者**：Stuart H. Sul, Simran Arora, Benjamin F. Spector, Christopher R\'e

Inter-GPU communication has become a major bottleneck for modern AI workloads as models scale and improvements in hardware compute throughput outpace improvements in interconnect bandwidth. Existing systems mitigate this through compute-communication overlap but often fail to meet theoretical peak performance across heterogeneous workloads and new accelerators. Instead of operator-specific techniques, we ask whether a small set of simple, reusable principles can systematically guide the design of optimal multi-GPU kernels. We present ParallelKittens (PK), a minimal CUDA framework that drastically simplifies the development of overlapped multi-GPU kernels. PK extends the ThunderKittens framework and embodies the principles of multi-GPU kernel design through eight core primitives and a unified programming template, derived from a comprehensive analysis of the factors that govern multi-GPU performance$\unicode{x2014}$data-transfer mechanisms, resource scheduling, and design overheads. We validate PK on both Hopper and Blackwell architectures. With fewer than 50 lines of device code, PK achieves up to $2.33 \times$ speedup for data- and tensor-parallel workloads, $4.08 \times$ for sequence-parallel workloads, and $1.22 \times$ for expert-parallel workloads.

### [10Cache: Heterogeneous Resource-Aware Tensor Caching and Migration for LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14124)
**作者**：Sabiha Afroz, Redwan Ibne Seraj Khan, Hadeel Albahar, Jingoo Han, Ali R. Butt

Training large language models (LLMs) in the cloud faces growing memory bottlenecks due to the limited capacity and high cost of GPUs. While GPU memory offloading to CPU and NVMe has made large-scale training more feasible, existing approaches suffer from high tensor migration latency and suboptimal device memory utilization, ultimately increasing training time and cloud costs. To address these challenges, we present 10Cache, a resource-aware tensor caching and migration system that accelerates LLM training by intelligently coordinating memory usage across GPU, CPU, and NVMe tiers. 10Cache profiles tensor execution order to construct prefetch policies, allocates memory buffers in pinned memory based on tensor size distributions, and reuses memory buffers to minimize allocation overhead.  Designed for cloud-scale deployments, 10Cache improves memory efficiency and reduces reliance on high-end GPUs. Across diverse LLM workloads, it achieves up to 2x speedup in training time, improves GPU cache hit rate by up to 86.6x, and increases CPU/GPU memory utilization by up to 2.15x and 1.33x, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art offloading methods. These results demonstrate that 10Cache is a practical and scalable solution for optimizing LLM training throughput and resource efficiency in cloud environments.

### [Seer: Online Context Learning for Fast Synchronous LLM Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14617)
**作者**：Ruoyu Qin, Weiran He, Weixiao Huang, Yangkun Zhang, Yikai Zhao, Bo Pang, Xinran Xu, Yingdi Shan, Yongwei Wu, Mingxing Zhang

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become critical for advancing modern Large Language Models (LLMs), yet existing synchronous RL systems face severe performance bottlenecks. The rollout phase, which dominates end-to-end iteration time, suffers from substantial long-tail latency and poor resource utilization due to inherent workload imbalance. We present Seer, a novel online context learning system that addresses these challenges by exploiting previously overlooked similarities in output lengths and generation patterns among requests sharing the same prompt. Seer introduces three key techniques: divided rollout for dynamic load balancing, context-aware scheduling, and adaptive grouped speculative decoding. Together, these mechanisms substantially reduce long-tail latency and improve resource efficiency during rollout. Evaluations on production-grade RL workloads demonstrate that Seer improves end-to-end rollout throughput by 74% to 97% and reduces long-tail latency by 75% to 93% compared to state-of-the-art synchronous RL systems, significantly accelerating RL training iterations.

### [Analyzing the Impact of Participant Failures in Cross-Silo Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14456)

Federated learning (FL) is a new paradigm for training machine learning (ML) models without sharing data. While applying FL in cross-silo scenarios, where organizations collaborate, it is necessary that the FL system is reliable; however, participants can fail due to various reasons (e.g., communication issues or misconfigurations). In order to provide a reliable system, it is necessary to analyze the impact of participant failures. While this problem received attention in cross-device FL where mobile devices with limited resources participate, there is comparatively little research in cross-silo FL.  Therefore, we conduct an extensive study for analyzing the impact of participant failures on the model quality in the context of inter-organizational cross-silo FL with few participants. In our study, we focus on analyzing generally influential factors such as the impact of the timing and the data as well as the impact on the evaluation, which is important for deciding, if the model should be deployed. We show that under high skews the evaluation is optimistic and hides the real impact. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the timing impacts the quality of the trained model. Our results offer insights for researchers and software architects aiming to build robust FL systems.

### [Multi-GPU Quantum Circuit Simulation and the Impact of Network Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14664)
**作者**：W. Michael Brown, Anurag Ramesh, Thomas Lubinski, Thien Nguyen, David E. Bernal Neira

As is intrinsic to the fundamental goal of quantum computing, classical simulation of quantum algorithms is notoriously demanding in resource requirements. Nonetheless, simulation is critical to the success of the field and a requirement for algorithm development and validation, as well as hardware design. GPU-acceleration has become standard practice for simulation, and due to the exponential scaling inherent in classical methods, multi-GPU simulation can be required to achieve representative system sizes. In this case, inter-GPU communications can bottleneck performance. In this work, we present the introduction of MPI into the QED-C Application-Oriented Benchmarks to facilitate benchmarking on HPC systems. We review the advances in interconnect technology and the APIs for multi-GPU communication. We benchmark using a variety of interconnect paths, including the recent NVIDIA Grace Blackwell NVL72 architecture that represents the first product to expand high-bandwidth GPU-specialized interconnects across multiple nodes. We show that while improvements to GPU architecture have led to speedups of over 4.5X across the last few generations of GPUs, advances in interconnect performance have had a larger impact with over 16X performance improvements in time to solution for multi-GPU simulations.

### [From Legacy Fortran to Portable Kokkos: An Autonomous Agentic AI Workflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12443)
**作者**：Sparsh Gupta, Kamalavasan Kamalakkannan, Maxim Moraru, Galen Shipman, Patrick Diehl

Scientific applications continue to rely on legacy Fortran codebases originally developed for homogeneous, CPU-based systems. As High-Performance Computing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many accelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize legacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance portability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos porting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully autonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains largely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse hardware. This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM "agents" collaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline modernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos codes across hardware partitions. Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating optimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models like Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes. This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos transformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy scientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse supercomputers. It further highlights the potential of LLM-driven agentic systems to perform structured, domain-specific reasoning tasks in scientific and systems-oriented applications.

### [MoE-SpeQ: Speculative Quantized Decoding with Proactive Expert Prefetching and Offloading for Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14102)
**作者**：Wenfeng Wang, Jiacheng Liu, Xiaofeng Hou, Xinfeng Xia, Peng Tang, Mingxuan Zhang, Chao Li, Minyi Guo

The immense memory requirements of state-of-the-art Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models present a significant challenge for inference, often exceeding the capacity of a single accelerator. While offloading experts to host memory is a common solution, it introduces a severe I/O bottleneck over the PCIe bus, as the data-dependent nature of expert selection places these synchronous transfers directly on the critical path of execution, crippling performance.  This paper argues that the I/O bottleneck can be overcome by trading a small amount of cheap, on-device computation to hide the immense cost of data movement. We present MoE-SpeQ, a new inference system built on a novel co-design of speculative execution and expert offloading. MoE-SpeQ employs a small, on-device draft model to predict the sequence of required experts for future tokens. This foresight enables a runtime orchestrator to prefetch these experts from host memory, effectively overlapping the expensive I/O with useful computation and hiding the latency from the critical path. To maximize performance, an adaptive governor, guided by an Amortization Roofline Model, dynamically tunes the speculation strategy to the underlying hardware. Our evaluation on memory-constrained devices shows that for the Phi-MoE model, MoE-SpeQ achieves at most 2.34x speedup over the state-of-the-art offloading framework. Our work establishes a new, principled approach for managing data-dependent memory access in resource-limited environments, making MoE inference more accessible on commodity hardware.

### [Overview and Prospects of Using Integer Surrogate Keys for Data Warehouse Performance Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14502)
**作者**：Sviatoslav Stumpf, Vladislav Povyshev

The aim of this paper is to examine and demonstrate how integer-based datetime labels (integer surrogate keys for time) can optimize data-warehouse and time-series performance, proposing practical formats and algorithms and validating their efficiency on real-world workloads. It is shown that replacing standard DATE and TIMESTAMP types with 32- and 64-bit integer formats reduces storage requirements by 30-60 percent and speeds up query execution by 25-40 percent. The paper presents indexing, aggregation, compression, and batching algorithms demonstrating up to an eightfold increase in throughput. Practical examples from finance, telecommunications, IoT, and scientific research confirm the efficiency and versatility of the proposed approach.

### [\textit{FLARE}: Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Reputation for Robust Client Reliability in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14715)
**作者**：Abolfazl Younesi, Leon Kiss, Zahra Najafabadi Samani, Juan Aznar Poveda, Thomas Fahringer

Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, it remains vulnerable to malicious clients who compromise model integrity through Byzantine attacks, data poisoning, or adaptive adversarial behaviors. Existing defense mechanisms rely on static thresholds and binary classification, failing to adapt to evolving client behaviors in real-world deployments. We propose FLARE, an adaptive reputation-based framework that transforms client reliability assessment from binary decisions to a continuous, multi-dimensional trust evaluation. FLARE integrates: (i) a multi-dimensional reputation score capturing performance consistency, statistical anomaly indicators, and temporal behavior, (ii) a self-calibrating adaptive threshold mechanism that adjusts security strictness based on model convergence and recent attack intensity, (iii) reputation-weighted aggregation with soft exclusion to proportionally limit suspicious contributions rather than eliminating clients outright, and (iv) a Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanism enabling reputation scoring on privatized client updates. We further introduce a highly evasive Statistical Mimicry (SM) attack, a benchmark adversary that blends honest gradients with synthetic perturbations and persistent drift to remain undetected by traditional filters. Extensive experiments with 100 clients on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that FLARE maintains high model accuracy and converges faster than state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust methods under diverse attack types, including label flipping, gradient scaling, adaptive attacks, ALIE, and SM. FLARE improves robustness by up to 16% and preserves model convergence within 30% of the non-attacked baseline, while achieving strong malicious-client detection performance with minimal computational overhead. https://github.com/Anonymous0-0paper/FLARE

### [Preparation Meets Opportunity: Enhancing Data Preprocessing for ML Training With Seneca](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13724)

Input data preprocessing is a common bottleneck when concurrently training multimedia machine learning (ML) models in modern systems. To alleviate these bottlenecks and reduce the training time for concurrent jobs, we present Seneca, a data loading system that optimizes cache partitioning and data sampling for the data storage and ingestion (DSI) pipeline. The design of Seneca contains two key techniques. First, Seneca uses a performance model for the data pipeline to optimally partition the cache for three different forms of data (encoded, decoded, and augmented). Second, Seneca opportunistically serves cached data over uncached ones during random batch sampling so that concurrent jobs benefit from each other. We implement Seneca by modifying PyTorch and demonstrate its effectiveness by comparing it against several state-of-the-art caching systems for DNN training. Seneca reduces the makespan by 45.23% compared to PyTorch and increases data processing throughput by up to 3.45x compared to the next best dataloader.
