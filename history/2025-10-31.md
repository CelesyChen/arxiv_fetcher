### [Outperforming Multiserver SRPT at All Loads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25963)
**作者**：Izzy Grosof, Daniela Hurtado-Lange

A well-designed scheduling policy can unlock significant performance improvements with no additional resources. Multiserver SRPT (SRPT-$k$) is known to achieve asymptotically optimal mean response time in the heavy traffic limit, as load approaches capacity. No better policy is known for the M/G/$k$ queue in any regime.  We introduce a new policy, SRPT-Except-$k+1$ & Modified SRPT (SEK-SMOD), which is the first policy to provably achieve lower mean response time than SRPT-$k$. SEK-SMOD outperforms SRPT-$k$ across all loads and all job size distributions. The key idea behind SEK-SMOD is to prioritize large jobs over small jobs in specific scenarios to improve server utilization, and thereby improve the response time of subsequent jobs in expectation. Our proof is a novel application of hybrid worst-case and stochastic techniques to relative analysis, where we analyze the deviations of our proposed SEK-SMOD policy away from the SRPT-$k$ baseline policy. Furthermore, we design Practical-SEK (a simplified variant of SEK-SMOD) and empirically verify the improvement over SRPT-$k$ via simulation.

### [Detecting Anomalies in Machine Learning Infrastructure via Hardware Telemetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26008)
**作者**：Ziji Chen, Steven Chien, Peng Qian, Noa Zilberman

Modern machine learning (ML) has grown into a tightly coupled, full-stack ecosystem that combines hardware, software, network, and applications. Many users rely on cloud providers for elastic, isolated, and cost-efficient resources. Unfortunately, these platforms as a service use virtualization, which means operators have little insight into the users' workloads. This hinders resource optimizations by the operator, which is essential to ensure cost efficiency and minimize execution time. In this paper, we argue that workload knowledge is unnecessary for system-level optimization. We propose System-X, which takes a \emph{hardware-centric} approach, relying only on hardware signals -- fully accessible by operators. Using low-level signals collected from the system, System-X detects anomalies through an unsupervised learning pipeline. The pipeline is developed by analyzing over 30 popular ML models on various hardware platforms, ensuring adaptability to emerging workloads and unknown deployment patterns. Using System-X, we successfully identified both network and system configuration issues, accelerating the DeepSeek model by 5.97%.

### [Approximating Heavy-Tailed Distributions with a Mixture of Bernstein Phase-Type and Hyperexponential Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26524)
**作者**：Abdelhakim Ziani, Andr\'as Horv\'ath, Paolo Ballarini

Heavy-tailed distributions, prevalent in a lot of real-world applications such as finance, telecommunications, queuing theory, and natural language processing, are challenging to model accurately owing to their slow tail decay. Bernstein phase-type (BPH) distributions, through their analytical tractability and good approximations in the non-tail region, can present a good solution, but they suffer from an inability to reproduce these heavy-tailed behaviors exactly, thus leading to inadequate performance in important tail areas. On the contrary, while highly adaptable to heavy-tailed distributions, hyperexponential (HE) models struggle in the body part of the distribution. Additionally, they are highly sensitive to initial parameter selection, significantly affecting their precision.  To solve these issues, we propose a novel hybrid model of BPH and HE distributions, borrowing the most desirable features from each for enhanced approximation quality. Specifically, we leverage an optimization to set initial parameters for the HE component, significantly enhancing its robustness and reducing the possibility that the associated procedure results in an invalid HE model. Experimental validation demonstrates that the novel hybrid approach is more performant than individual application of BPH or HE models. More precisely, it can capture both the body and the tail of heavy-tailed distributions, with a considerable enhancement in matching parameters such as mean and coefficient of variation. Additional validation through experiments utilizing queuing theory proves the practical usefulness, accuracy, and precision of our hybrid approach.

### [ExpertFlow: Adaptive Expert Scheduling and Memory Coordination for Efficient MoE Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26730)
**作者**：Zixu Shen, Kexin Chu, Yifan Zhang, Dawei Xiang, Runxin Wu, Wei Zhang

The expansion of large language models is increasingly limited by the constrained memory capacity of modern GPUs. To mitigate this, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures activate only a small portion of parameters during inference, significantly lowering both memory demand and computational overhead. However, conventional MoE inference approaches, which select active experts independently at each layer, often introduce considerable latency because of frequent parameter transfers between host and GPU memory. In addition, current cross-layer prediction strategies, which are typically based on fixed steps, lack adaptability across different hardware platforms and workloads, thereby reducing their robustness and effectiveness.  To address these challenges, we present ExpertFlow, a runtime system for MoE inference that combines adaptive expert prefetching and cache-aware routing. ExpertFlow continuously adjusts its prediction horizon for expert activation by leveraging runtime statistics such as transfer bandwidth, parameter dimensionality, and model feedback signals. Furthermore, it incorporates a hybrid cross-layer prediction scheme that fuses pregating information with intermediate computational states to anticipate future expert needs. By adaptively refining prefetching decisions and aligning them with actual usage behavior, ExpertFlow effectively decreases cache misses and removes latency caused by expert swap-ins. Our evaluation demonstrates that ExpertFlow reduces model stall time to less than 0.1% of the baseline, highlighting its capability to optimize MoE inference under stringent memory constraints.

### [Runtime Repeated Recursion Unfolding in CHR: A Just-In-Time Online Program Optimization Strategy That Can Achieve Super-Linear Speedup](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02180)
**作者**：Thom Fruehwirth

We introduce a just-in-time runtime program transformation strategy based on repeated recursion unfolding. Our online program optimization generates several versions of a recursion differentiated by the minimal number of recursive steps covered. The base case of the recursion is ignored in our technique.  Our method is introduced here on the basis of single linear direct recursive rules. When a recursive call is encountered at runtime, first an unfolder creates specializations of the associated recursive rule on-the-fly and then an interpreter applies these rules to the call. Our approach reduces the number of recursive rule applications to its logarithm at the expense of introducing a logarithmic number of generic unfolded rules.  We prove correctness of our online optimization technique and determine its time complexity. For recursions which have enough simplifyable unfoldings, a super-linear is possible, i.e. speedup by more than a constant factor. The necessary simplification is problem-specific and has to be provided at compile-time. In our speedup analysis, we prove a sufficient condition as well as a sufficient and necessary condition for super-linear speedup relating the complexity of the recursive steps of the original rule and the unfolded rules.  We have implemented an unfolder and meta-interpreter for runtime repeated recursion unfolding with just five rules in Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) embedded in Prolog. We illustrate the feasibility of our approach with simplifications, time complexity results and benchmarks for some basic tractable algorithms. The simplifications require some insight and were derived manually. The runtime improvement quickly reaches several orders of magnitude, consistent with the super-linear speedup predicted by our theorems.

### [Mind the Gap: Removing the Discretization Gap in Differentiable Logic Gate Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07500)
**作者**：Shakir Yousefi, Andreas Plesner, Till Aczel, Roger Wattenhofer

Modern neural networks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on numerous existing benchmarks; however, their high computational requirements and energy consumption prompt researchers to seek more efficient solutions for real-world deployment. Logic gate networks (LGNs) learns a large network of logic gates for efficient image classification. However, learning a network that can solve a simple problem like CIFAR-10 can take days to weeks to train. Even then, almost half of the network remains unused, causing a discretization gap. This discretization gap hinders real-world deployment of LGNs, as the performance drop between training and inference negatively impacts accuracy. We inject Gumbel noise with a straight-through estimator during training to significantly speed up training, improve neuron utilization, and decrease the discretization gap. We theoretically show that this results from implicit Hessian regularization, which improves the convergence properties of LGNs. We train networks $4.5 \times$ faster in wall-clock time, reduce the discretization gap by $98\%$, and reduce the number of unused gates by $100\%$.

### [CHIPSIM: A Co-Simulation Framework for Deep Learning on Chiplet-Based Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25958)
**作者**：Lukas Pfromm, Alish Kanani, Harsh Sharma, Janardhan Rao Doppa, Partha Pratim Pande, Umit Y. Ogras

Due to reduced manufacturing yields, traditional monolithic chips cannot keep up with the compute, memory, and communication demands of data-intensive applications, such as rapidly growing deep neural network (DNN) models. Chiplet-based architectures offer a cost-effective and scalable solution by integrating smaller chiplets via a network-on-interposer (NoI). Fast and accurate simulation approaches are critical to unlocking this potential, but existing methods lack the required accuracy, speed, and flexibility. To address this need, this work presents CHIPSIM, a comprehensive co-simulation framework designed for parallel DNN execution on chiplet-based systems. CHIPSIM concurrently models computation and communication, accurately capturing network contention and pipelining effects that conventional simulators overlook. Furthermore, it profiles the chiplet and NoI power consumptions at microsecond granularity for precise transient thermal analysis. Extensive evaluations with homogeneous/heterogeneous chiplets and different NoI architectures demonstrate the framework's versatility, up to 340% accuracy improvement, and power/thermal analysis capability.

### [MIREDO: MIP-Driven Resource-Efficient Dataflow Optimization for Computing-in-Memory Accelerator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26463)
**作者**：Xiaolin He, Cenlin Duan, Yingjie Qi, Xiao Ma, Jianlei Yang

Computing-in-Memory (CIM) architectures have emerged as a promising solution for accelerating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by mitigating data movement bottlenecks. However, realizing the potential of CIM requires specialized dataflow optimizations, which are challenged by an expansive design space and strict architectural constraints. Existing optimization approaches often fail to fully exploit CIM accelerators, leading to noticeable gaps between theoretical and actual system-level efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the MIREDO framework, which formulates dataflow optimization as a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problem. MIREDO introduces a hierarchical hardware abstraction coupled with an analytical latency model designed to accurately reflect the complex data transfer behaviors within CIM systems. By jointly modeling workload characteristics, dataflow strategies, and CIM-specific constraints, MIREDO systematically navigates the vast design space to determine the optimal dataflow configurations. Evaluation results demonstrate that MIREDO significantly enhances performance, achieving up to $3.2\times$ improvement across various DNN models and hardware setups.

### [Wireless Sensor Networks as Parallel and Distributed Hardware Platform for Artificial Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26492)
**作者**：Gursel Serpen

We are proposing fully parallel and maximally distributed hardware realization of a generic neuro-computing system. More specifically, the proposal relates to the wireless sensor networks technology to serve as a massively parallel and fully distributed hardware platform to implement and realize artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms. A parallel and distributed (PDP) hardware realization of ANNs makes it possible to have real time computation of large-scale (and complex) problems in a highly robust framework. We will demonstrate how a network of hundreds of thousands of processing nodes (or motes of a wireless sensor network), which have on-board processing and wireless communication features, can be used to implement fully parallel and massively distributed computation of artificial neural network algorithms for solution of truly large-scale problems in real time. The realization of artificial neural network algorithms in a massively parallel and fully distributed hardware has been the goal of neural network computing researchers. This is because a parallel and distributed computation of artificial neural network algorithms could not have been achieved against all the advancements in silicon- or optics-based computing. Accordingly, artificial neural networks could not be applied to very large-scale problems for real time computation of solutions. This hindered the development of neural algorithms for affordable and practical solutions of challenging problems since often special-purpose computing approaches in hardware, software or hybrid (non-neural) had to be developed for and fine-tuned to specific problems that are very large-scale and highly complex. Successful implementation is likely to revolutionize computing as we know it by making it possible to solve very large scale scientific, engineering or technical problems in real time.

### [Foundations of Fiat-Denominated Loans Collateralized by Cryptocurrencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25878)
**作者**：Pavel Hub\'a\v{c}ek, Jan V\'aclavek, Michelle Yeo

The rising importance of cryptocurrencies as financial assets pushed their applicability from an object of speculation closer to standard financial instruments such as loans. In this work, we initiate the study of secure protocols that enable fiat-denominated loans collateralized by cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. We provide limited-custodial protocols for such loans relying only on trusted arbitration and provide their game-theoretical analysis. We also highlight various interesting directions for future research.

### [Environmental Impact of CI/CD Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26413)
**作者**：Nuno Saavedra, Alexandra Mendes, Jo\~ao F. Ferreira

CI/CD pipelines are widely used in software development, yet their environmental impact, particularly carbon and water footprints (CWF), remains largely unknown to developers, as CI service providers typically do not disclose such information. With the growing environmental impact of cloud computing, understanding the CWF of CI/CD services has become increasingly important.  This work investigates the CWF of using GitHub Actions, focusing on open-source repositories where usage is free and unlimited for standard runners. We build upon a methodology from the Cloud Carbon Footprint framework and we use the largest dataset of workflow runs reported in the literature to date, comprising over 2.2 million workflow runs from more than 18,000 repositories.  Our analysis reveals that the GitHub Actions ecosystem results in a substantial CWF. Our estimates for the carbon footprint in 2024 range from 150.5 MTCO2e in the most optimistic scenario to 994.9 MTCO2e in the most pessimistic scenario, while the water footprint ranges from 1,989.6 to 37,664.5 kiloliters. The most likely scenario estimates are 456.9 MTCO2e for carbon footprint and 5,738.2 kiloliters for water footprint. To provide perspective, the carbon footprint in the most likely scenario is equivalent to the carbon captured by 7,615 urban trees in a year, and the water footprint is comparable to the water consumed by an average American family over 5,053 years.  We explore strategies to mitigate this impact, primarily by reducing wasted computational resources. Key recommendations include deploying runners in regions whose energy production has a low environmental impact such as France and the United Kingdom, implementing stricter deactivation policies for scheduled runs and aligning their execution with periods when the regional energy mix is more environmentally favorable, and reducing the size of repositories.

### [ReSpec: Towards Optimizing Speculative Decoding in Reinforcement Learning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26475)
**作者**：Qiaoling Chen, Zijun Liu, Peng Sun, Shenggui Li, Guoteng Wang, Ziming Liu, Yonggang Wen, Siyuan Feng, Tianwei Zhang

Adapting large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) is often bottlenecked by the generation stage, which can consume over 75\% of the training time. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive generation in serving systems, but its behavior under RL training remains largely unexplored. We identify three critical gaps that hinder the naive integration of SD into RL systems: diminishing speedups at large batch sizes, drafter staleness under continual actor updates, and drafter-induced policy degradation.  To address these gaps, we present ReSpec, a system that adapts SD to RL through three complementary mechanisms: dynamically tuning SD configurations, evolving the drafter via knowledge distillation, and weighting updates by rollout rewards. On Qwen models (3B--14B), ReSpec achieves up to 4.5x speedup while preserving reward convergence and training stability, providing a practical solution for efficient RL-based LLM adaptation.

### [An All-Reduce Compatible Top-K Compressor for Communication-Efficient Distributed Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26709)
**作者**：Chuyan Chen, Chenyang Ma, Zhangxin Li, Yutong He, Yanjie Dong, Kun Yuan

Communication remains a central bottleneck in large-scale distributed machine learning, and gradient sparsification has emerged as a promising strategy to alleviate this challenge. However, existing gradient compressors face notable limitations: Rand-$K$\ discards structural information and performs poorly in practice, while Top-$K$\ preserves informative entries but loses the contraction property and requires costly All-Gather operations. In this paper, we propose ARC-Top-$K$, an {All-Reduce}-Compatible Top-$K$ compressor that aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using a lightweight sketch of the gradient, enabling index-free All-Reduce while preserving globally significant information. ARC-Top-$K$\ is provably contractive and, when combined with momentum error feedback (EF21M), achieves linear speedup and sharper convergence rates than the original EF21M under standard assumptions. Empirically, ARC-Top-$K$\ matches the accuracy of Top-$K$\ while reducing wall-clock training time by up to 60.7\%, offering an efficient and scalable solution that combines the robustness of Rand-$K$\ with the strong performance of Top-$K$.

### [Non-Convex Over-the-Air Heterogeneous Federated Learning: A Bias-Variance Trade-off](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26722)
**作者**：Muhammad Faraz Ul Abrar, Nicol\`o Michelusi

Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming \emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous} wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured, time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL baselines.

### [SHARE: Optimizing Secure Hub Allocation and Routing Efficiency in Payment Channel Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04236)
**作者**：Lingxiao Yang, Xuewen Dong, Wei Wang, Yong Yu, Sheng Gao, Qiang Qu, Yulong Shen

Payment channel hub (PCH), by leveraging a powerful hub to reliably provide off-chain payment services, offers an effective enhancement to payment channel networks (PCNs). However, existing approaches typically rely on a single hub to relay transactions and provide relationship anonymity between participants. This design lacks flexibility under high-frequency transaction scenarios and fail to adequately balance the security of off-chain payments with PCH efficiency. Moreover, current PCNs often adopt source routing, where each transaction path is predetermined without considering the dynamic distribution of large-scale payment requests, leading to load imbalance and even transaction deadlocks. To address these issues, we propose SHARE, a multi-PCH distributed routing scheme based on trusted execution environments (TEE), designed to optimize secure hub allocation and routing efficiency in PCNs. For the multi-hub allocation problem, SHARE balances the management and synchronization costs among participants, and employs mixed-integer linear programming along with supermodular optimization techniques to transform the NP-hard problem into a solvable form, enabling optimal or approximate solutions across various PCN scales. At the routing layer, SHARE integrates global network state with local sender requests to design a TEE-assisted, privacy-preserving distributed routing protocol that dynamically adjusts multipath flow rates, achieving high-throughput and deadlock-free transaction forwarding. We formally prove the security of the SHARE protocol under the universally composable framework. Experimental results demonstrate that SHARE achieves a 43.6% improvement in transaction success ratio and an over 181.5% enhancement in system throughput compared to state-of-the-art PCN solutions, effectively realizing a secure extension of PCNs.

### [MemAscend: System Memory Optimization for SSD-Offloaded LLM Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23254)
**作者**：Yong-Cheng Liaw, Shuo-Han Chen

Owing to the huge success of generative artificial intelligence (AI), large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a core subclass, underpinning applications such as question answering, text generation, and code completion. While fine-tuning these models on domain-specific data can yield significant performance gains, it also poses daunting computational challenges, especially for researchers and small organizations with limited hardware resources. Although SSD offloading (i.e., ZeRO-Infinity) has emerged as a viable strategy to overcome the GPU memory barrier via leveraging both system memory (i.e., CPU DRAM) and storage space (i.e., solid-state devices, SSDs), its design primarily targets model-centric performance issues. As a result, key system-level issues, including system memory fragmentation, inefficient pinned buffer allocation, peak CPU usage spikes, and file system overhead, remain unaddressed, stifling scalability and inflating costs. Such an observation motivates this paper to introduce MemAscend, a framework that systematically tackles the underexplored system memory bottlenecks in SSD-offloaded LLM training, with a focus on resource-constrained environments. By streamlining pinned-memory allocation, eradicating fragmentation, and mitigating peak overhead, MemAscend reclaims a substantial system memory budget, enabling larger models, longer context windows, and higher batch sizes without exceeding modest hardware limits. Across diverse LLM benchmarks, MemAscend reduces peak system-memory consumption by an average of 55.7% compared with standard SSD offloading techniques, lowering the hardware barrier for fine-tuning and unlocking new possibilities for cost-effective large-scale training on limited-resource machines.

### [Analysis and Optimized CXL-Attached Memory Allocation for Long-Context LLM Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03305)
**作者**：Yong-Cheng Liaw, Shuo-Han Chen

The substantial memory requirements of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for long-context fine-tuning, have renewed interest in CPU offloading to augment limited GPU memory. However, as context lengths grow, relying on CPU memory for intermediate states introduces a significant bottleneck that can exhaust the capacity of mainstream client platforms. To address this limitation, this work investigates the effectiveness of Compute Express Link (CXL) add-in card (AIC) memory as an extension to CPU memory, enabling larger model sizes and longer context lengths during fine-tuning. Extensive benchmarking reveals two critical challenges. First, current deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch lack fine-grained, per-tensor control over NUMA memory allocation, exposing only coarse, process-level policies. Second, due to this lack of control, when the memory footprint of fine-tuning is offloaded across local DRAM and CXL-attached memory, naively placing optimizer data in higher-latency CXL leads to substantial slowdowns in the optimizer step (e.g., 4x once data exceeds 20M elements). To overcome these challenges, this work introduces a PyTorch extension that enables tensor-level system memory control and a CXL-aware memory allocator that pins latency-critical tensors in local DRAM while maximizing bandwidth by striping latency-tolerant tensors across one or more CXL devices. Evaluated on a real hardware setup with 7B and 12B models, 4K-32K contexts, and a single GPU, our approach recovers throughput to 97-99% of DRAM-only with a single AIC and approximately 100% with two AICs, delivering up to 21% improvement over naive interleaving while preserving DRAM-like DMA bandwidth for GPU transfers. These results show that carefully managed CXL-attached memory is a practical path to scaling long-context fine-tuning beyond DRAM limits.

### [HyGen: Efficient LLM Serving via Elastic Online-Offline Request Co-location](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14808)
**作者**：Ting Sun, Penghan Wang, Fan Lai

Large language models (LLMs) have facilitated a wide range of applications with distinct service-level objectives (SLOs), from latency-sensitive online tasks like interactive chatbots to throughput-oriented offline workloads like data synthesis. The existing deployment model, which dedicates machines to each workload, simplifies SLO management but often leads to poor resource utilization. This paper introduces HyGen, an interference-aware LLM serving system that enables efficient co-location of online and offline workloads while preserving SLOs. HyGen incorporates two key innovations: (1) performance control mechanisms, including a latency predictor to estimate batch execution time and an SLO-aware profiler to quantify latency interference, and (2) SLO-aware offline scheduling policies that maximize serving throughput and prevent starvation. Our evaluation on production workloads shows that HyGen achieves up to 3.9-5.8x throughput gains over online and hybrid serving baselines, while ensuring latency SLOs. The code of HyGen is publicly available at https://github.com/UIUC-MLSys/HyGen.

### [TokenWeave: Efficient Compute-Communication Overlap for Distributed LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11329)
**作者**：Raja Gond, Nipun Kwatra, Ramachandran Ramjee

Distributed inference of large language models (LLMs) can introduce overheads of up to 20% even over GPUs connected via high-speed interconnects such as NVLink. Multiple techniques have been proposed to mitigate these overheads by decomposing computations into finer-grained tasks and overlapping communication with sub-tasks as they complete. However, fine-grained decomposition of a large computation into many smaller computations on GPUs results in overheads. Furthermore, the communication itself uses many streaming multiprocessors (SMs), adding to the overhead.  We present TokenWeave to address these challenges. TokenWeave proposes a Token-Splitting technique that divides the tokens in the inference batch into two approximately equal subsets in a wave-aware manner. The communication of one subset is then overlapped with the computation of the other. In addition, TokenWeave optimizes the order of the layer normalization computation with respect to communication operations and implements a novel fused AllReduce--RMSNorm kernel that carefully leverages Multimem instruction support available on Hopper and Blackwell NVIDIA GPUs. These optimizations allow TokenWeave to perform communication and RMSNorm using only 2-8 SMs. Moreover, our kernel enables the memory-bound RMSNorm to be overlapped with the other batch's computation, providing additional gains.  Our evaluations demonstrate up to 1.29x speedup in latency and 1.26x higher throughput across multiple models and workloads. In several settings, TokenWeave results in better performance compared to an equivalent model with all communication removed.

### [Time-Optimal and Energy-Efficient Deterministic Consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12282)
**作者**：Shachar Meir, Hugo Mirault, David Peleg, Peter Robinson

We study fault-tolerant consensus in a variant of the synchronous message passing model, where, in each round, every node can choose to be awake or asleep. This is known as the sleeping model (Chatterjee, Gmyr, Pandurangan PODC 2020) and defines the awake complexity (also called \emph{energy complexity}), which measures the maximum number of rounds that any node is awake throughout the execution. Only awake nodes can send and receive messages in a given round and all messages sent to sleeping nodes are lost. We present new deterministic consensus algorithms that tolerate up to $f<n$ crash failures, where $n$ is the number of nodes. Our algorithms match the optimal time complexity lower bound of $f+1$ rounds. For multi-value consensus, where the input values are chosen from some possibly large set, we achieve an energy complexity of ${O}(\lceil f^2 / n \rceil)$ rounds, whereas for binary consensus, we show that ${O}(\lceil f / \sqrt{n} \rceil)$ rounds are possible.

### [AIMeter: Measuring, Analyzing, and Visualizing Energy and Carbon Footprint of AI Workloads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20535)
**作者**：Hongzhen Huang, Kunming Zhang, Hanlong Liao, Kui Wu, Guoming Tang

The rapid advancement of AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), has raised significant concerns about the energy use and carbon emissions associated with model training and inference. However, existing tools for measuring and reporting such impacts are often fragmented, lacking systematic metric integration and offering limited support for correlation analysis among them. This paper presents AIMeter, a comprehensive software toolkit for the measurement, analysis, and visualization of energy use, power draw, hardware performance, and carbon emissions across AI workloads. By seamlessly integrating with existing AI frameworks, AIMeter offers standardized reports and exports fine-grained time-series data to support benchmarking and reproducibility in a lightweight manner. It further enables in-depth correlation analysis between hardware metrics and model performance and thus facilitates bottleneck identification and performance enhancement. By addressing critical limitations in existing tools, AIMeter encourages the research community to weigh environmental impact alongside raw performance of AI workloads and advances the shift toward more sustainable "Green AI" practices.

### [DSDE: Dynamic Speculative Decoding with KLD Stability for Real-World Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01083)
**作者**：Mingyu Yang, Jae-Young Choi, Kihyo Moon, Minsung Jang, Eunjoo Jeon

Speculative decoding accelerates large language model inference, but its reliance on a fixed speculation length is suboptimal in large-batch serving environments with diverse requests. This paper explores a new direction for dynamic adaptation by investigating a novel class of post-hoc, diagnostic signals. We propose Dynamic Speculative Decoding Engine (DSDE), a training-free framework built on two primary components: (1) a predictive signal based on the variance of the Kullback-Leibler (KLD) divergence, which diagnoses the generation's regional stability, and (2) an adaptive speculation length cap to mitigate the straggler problem in per-sequence decoding. Experiments demonstrate the potential of using KLD-based stability signals for dynamic adaptation. An algorithm guided by these signals achieves end-to-end latency competitive with leading baselines and exhibits superior robustness across diverse workloads. This robustness is particularly valuable in challenging low-acceptance-rate regimes, where the proposed signal maintains its diagnostic utility. Collectively, these findings validate post-hoc signals as a valuable component for building more robust and intelligent LLM inference systems, and highlight a promising direction for future research on dynamic speculation length adaptation.

### [Oneiros: KV Cache Optimization through Parameter Remapping for Multi-tenant LLM Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11507)
**作者**：Ruihao Li, Shagnik Pal, Vineeth Narayan Pullu, Prasoon Sinha, Jeeho Ryoo, Lizy K. John, Neeraja J. Yadwadkar

KV cache accelerates LLM inference by avoiding redundant computation, at the expense of memory. To support larger KV caches, prior work extends GPU memory with CPU memory via CPU-offloading. This involves swapping KV cache between GPU and CPU memory. However, because the cache updates dynamically, such swapping incurs high CPU memory traffic. We make a key observation that model parameters remain constant during runtime, unlike the dynamically updated KV cache. Building on this, we introduce Oneiros, which avoids KV cache swapping by remapping, and thereby repurposing, the memory allocated to model parameters for KV cache. This parameter remapping is especially beneficial in multi-tenant environments, where the memory used for the parameters of the inactive models can be more aggressively reclaimed. Exploiting the high CPU-GPU bandwidth offered by the modern hardware, such as the NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip, we show that Oneiros significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, achieving a reduction of 44.8%-82.5% in tail time-between-token latency, 20.7%-99.3% in tail time-to-first-token latency, and 6.6%-86.7% higher throughput compared to vLLM. Source code of Oneiros is available at https://github.com/UT-SysML/Oneiros/.
